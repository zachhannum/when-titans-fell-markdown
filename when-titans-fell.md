# Introduction

**Long ago, titans roamed the land**. Massive creatures of unimaginable power whose vast shadows covered entire cities, and whose steps shook the foundation of the land beneath them. These titans were the gods of old, beings of immense strength and wisdom, whose existence shaped the very fabric of reality.

For eons, these titans ruled over Eldraia, a world teeming with life and magic. They were worshipped as divine beings, their every action said to shape the destiny of the world. But this is not their story. This is the story of what came after.

No one living knows why, but a cataclysmic war erupted amongst the titans. A war so devastating that their mutual destruction was all but inevitable. The world trembled, and the land was razed, reduced to ash.

When the dust settled and silence filled the air once more, Eldraia was forever changed. The titans lay lifeless on the ground—fallen gods reduced to nothing more than colossal carcasses strewn across the landscape.

The impact of their deaths was felt throughout Eldraia. The once vibrant world now lay in ruin—a desolate wasteland where darkness reigned supreme. The skies were eternally shrouded in gloom, pierced only by occasional bursts of eerie light from cracks in reality itself.

But even in death, the titans left behind remnants of their power—titan essence. This essence permeated their decaying bodies and seeped into the very fabric of Eldraia. It became a source of incredible power, coveted by the surviving inhabitants of a shattered world.

**Over a hundred years ago**, humanity emerged from their underground shelters to reclaim the surface. They discovered the latent power within the titan remains, and this newfound resource revolutionized human civilization.

From the ashes of civilization, new factions have emerged, each vying for control over the titan essence. The Slyphir wish to gather as much knowledge and essence as possible, hoarding it for their own research. The Order of the Ivory Eye sees it as a path to ascension and godhood. The Pact simply wish to use it to restore order to the lawless wastelands.

It is within this bleak and treacherous world that you find yourself—a **titan reaper**, one who ventures into the decaying husks of the fallen titans in search of their essence. Equipped with specialized tools and ancient knowledge, you navigate the labyrinthine interior of these colossal carcasses, facing dangers at every turn.

Titan reaping is not for the faint of heart. Locations of titan falls often form complex ecosystems of dangerous flora and fauna, creatures that have adapted and specialized in feeding off the essence themselves, not to mention rival Titan Reapers.

The task is dangerous, and in order to withstand the trials of reaping, titan reapers have adapted to harnessing the power of essence themselves, enhancing their abilities and granting them unique skills. But with great power comes great risk. Improper extraction or overexposure to essence can lead to physical mutations, mental instability, and a condition known as essence corruption.

## Titan Essence

Titan reapers work with essence in its various forms. Raw essence motes must be handled carefully. It’s unrefined form is volatile and acts almost as a living thing.

In this state, titan reapers can use it to enhance their own abilities, craft artifacts, or further refine essence for additional use as currency.

Titan essence is used for nearly everything in this world, and titan reapers stand at the fulcrum and must balance their own need for it against the greater need. Prolific titan reapers tow the line between survival and excess, as the more essence they harvest and use, the greater their risk of corruption. Many a seasoned reaper has succumbed to the allure of power, their bodies and minds twisted by overexposure until they become something no longer recognizably human.

## The World That Remains

After the death of the titans, Eldraia fell into an eternal twilight. The skies became perpetually overcast, and a thick fog settled upon the land, obscuring vision and muffling sound. This mysterious phenomenon is simply known as the **Dusk**.

In order to survive, pockets of humanity banded together to form underground cities known as **enclaves**. These enclaves are hidden beneath layers of rock and debris, offering protection against the dangers that lurk on the surface.

Each enclave has its own unique culture and society. Some enclaves focus on scientific advancements and technological innovation, while others embrace arcane arts and ancient rituals passed down through generations.

The landscape of Eldraia is now dominated by the massive corpses of the fallen titans. These colossal remains, known as "titan falls," have become both landmarks and dangerous frontiers. Some titan falls have become the foundations for settlements, with communities building directly into or around the massive cadavers. Others remain unexplored, their depths holding untold treasures and horrors.

Enclave dwellers have become adept at repurposing titan essence for various uses within their communities. It powers everything from arcane devices that provide energy to life-support systems that sustain their subterranean existence.

The death of the titans unleashed a wave of rapid evolution upon Eldraia's ecosystems. The essence that once flowed through the titan's veins has seeped into the surrounding environment, giving birth to an assortment of dangerous creatures range from grotesque abominations to cunning predators. Some have adapted to the harsh conditions of Eldraia, developing unique abilities and survival tactics. Others have been driven mad by the essence, their once noble forms twisted into horrifying visages.

**Titanborn** creatures are a constant threat to those who venture beyond the safety of the enclaves.

### Factions

In Eldraia, power is not solely wielded by individuals—it is also concentrated within factions that vie for control over titan essence. While there are many factions across all of Eldraia, here are a few of the largest.

- **The Order of the Ivory Eye**: Consider the Titans, even in their fallen state, to be divine. They believe that by harnessing the power of titan essence, they can ascend to godhood themselves. They seek to gather as much essence as possible, using it to enhance their own abilities and unlock ancient rituals of immense power.
- **The Brimstone Syndicate**: Is a ruthless group that seeks to control the flow of titan essence for their own gain. They are known for their brutal tactics and willingness to eliminate anyone who stands in their way.
- **The Sylphir**: Seekers of knowledge above all else, they delve deep into forbidden magics and ancient texts in their quest for understanding and power.
- **The Pact**: A coalition of enclaves seeking to restore order to the lawless wastelands, they believe that by uniting under a common banner, humanity can reclaim its lost glory.
