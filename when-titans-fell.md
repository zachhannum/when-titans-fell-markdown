# Introduction

**Long ago, titans roamed the land**. Massive creatures of unimaginable power whose vast shadows covered entire cities, and whose steps shook the foundation of the land beneath them. These titans were the gods of old, beings of immense strength and wisdom, whose existence shaped the very fabric of reality.

For eons, these titans ruled over Eldraia, a world teeming with life and magic. They were worshipped as divine beings, their every action said to shape the destiny of the world. But this is not their story. This is the story of what came after.

No one living knows why, but a cataclysmic war erupted amongst the titans. A war so devastating that their mutual destruction was all but inevitable. The world trembled, and the land was razed, reduced to ash.

When the dust settled and silence filled the air once more, Eldraia was forever changed. The titans lay lifeless on the ground—fallen gods reduced to nothing more than colossal carcasses strewn across the landscape.

The impact of their deaths was felt throughout Eldraia. The once vibrant world now lay in ruin—a desolate wasteland where darkness reigned supreme. The skies were eternally shrouded in gloom, pierced only by occasional bursts of eerie light from cracks in reality itself.

But even in death, the titans left behind remnants of their power—titan essence. This essence permeated their decaying bodies and seeped into the very fabric of Eldraia. It became a source of incredible power, coveted by the surviving inhabitants of a shattered world.

**Over a hundred years ago**, humanity emerged from their underground shelters to reclaim the surface. They discovered the latent power within the titan remains, and this newfound resource revolutionized human civilization.

From the ashes of civilization, new factions have emerged, each vying for control over the titan essence. The Slyphir wish to gather as much knowledge and essence as possible, hoarding it for their own research. The Order of the Ivory Eye sees it as a path to ascension and godhood. The Pact simply wish to use it to restore order to the lawless wastelands.

It is within this bleak and treacherous world that you find yourself—a **titan reaper**, one who ventures into the decaying husks of the fallen titans in search of their essence. Equipped with specialized tools and ancient knowledge, you navigate the labyrinthine interior of these colossal carcasses, facing dangers at every turn.

Titan reaping is not for the faint of heart. Locations of titan falls often form complex ecosystems of dangerous flora and fauna, creatures that have adapted and specialized in feeding off the essence themselves, not to mention rival Titan Reapers.

The task is dangerous, and in order to withstand the trials of reaping, titan reapers have adapted to harnessing the power of essence themselves, enhancing their abilities and granting them unique skills. But with great power comes great risk. Improper extraction or overexposure to essence can lead to physical mutations, mental instability, and a condition known as essence corruption.

## Titan Essence

Titan reapers work with essence in its various forms. Raw essence motes must be handled carefully. It’s unrefined form is volatile and acts almost as a living thing.

In this state, titan reapers can use it to enhance their own abilities, craft artifacts, or further refine essence for additional use as currency.

Titan essence is used for nearly everything in this world, and titan reapers stand at the fulcrum and must balance their own need for it against the greater need. Prolific titan reapers tow the line between survival and excess, as the more essence they harvest and use, the greater their risk of corruption. Many a seasoned reaper has succumbed to the allure of power, their bodies and minds twisted by overexposure until they become something no longer recognizably human.

## The World That Remains

After the death of the titans, Eldraia fell into an eternal twilight. The skies became perpetually overcast, and a thick fog settled upon the land, obscuring vision and muffling sound. This mysterious phenomenon is simply known as the **Dusk**.

In order to survive, pockets of humanity banded together to form underground cities known as **enclaves**. These enclaves are hidden beneath layers of rock and debris, offering protection against the dangers that lurk on the surface.

Each enclave has its own unique culture and society. Some enclaves focus on scientific advancements and technological innovation, while others embrace arcane arts and ancient rituals passed down through generations.

The landscape of Eldraia is now dominated by the massive corpses of the fallen titans. These colossal remains, known as "titan falls," have become both landmarks and dangerous frontiers. Some titan falls have become the foundations for settlements, with communities building directly into or around the massive cadavers. Others remain unexplored, their depths holding untold treasures and horrors.

Enclave dwellers have become adept at repurposing titan essence for various uses within their communities. It powers everything from arcane devices that provide energy to life-support systems that sustain their subterranean existence.

The death of the titans unleashed a wave of rapid evolution upon Eldraia's ecosystems. The essence that once flowed through the titan's veins has seeped into the surrounding environment, giving birth to an assortment of dangerous creatures range from grotesque abominations to cunning predators. Some have adapted to the harsh conditions of Eldraia, developing unique abilities and survival tactics. Others have been driven mad by the essence, their once noble forms twisted into horrifying visages.

**Titanborn** creatures are a constant threat to those who venture beyond the safety of the enclaves.

### Factions

In Eldraia, power is not solely wielded by individuals—it is also concentrated within factions that vie for control over titan essence. While there are many factions across all of Eldraia, here are a few of the largest.

- **The Order of the Ivory Eye**: Consider the Titans, even in their fallen state, to be divine. They believe that by harnessing the power of titan essence, they can ascend to godhood themselves. They seek to gather as much essence as possible, using it to enhance their own abilities and unlock ancient rituals of immense power.
- **The Brimstone Syndicate**: Is a ruthless group that seeks to control the flow of titan essence for their own gain. They are known for their brutal tactics and willingness to eliminate anyone who stands in their way.
- **The Sylphir**: Seekers of knowledge above all else, they delve deep into forbidden magics and ancient texts in their quest for understanding and power.
- **The Pact**: A coalition of enclaves seeking to restore order to the lawless wastelands, they believe that by uniting under a common banner, humanity can reclaim its lost glory.

As a titan reaper, you are not bound to any single faction. You may align yourself with a faction's cause or remain independent, navigating the complex web of alliances and rivalries that shape Eldraia's political landscape.

# Primer

Like most tabletop RPGs, your character's success at various tasks is determined through a combination of their capabilities (attributes, skills, abilities), external circumstances, and luck.. The game primarily uses a twenty-sided die (d20) for resolving actions, with your character's relevant attribute modifier and skill training adding to the roll.

What sets titan reapers apart is the essence system. Your character can push beyond normal human limits by channeling essence—the mysterious energy harvested from titan remains. By spending points from your **Essence Pool**, you can add **Surge Dice** to improve your chances of success or increase the effectiveness of your actions.

## Dice

What dice do you need?

## Rolling the dice

When your character is attempting to do something in which the success of failure of completing such a task impacts the story in a significant way, or when your character is directly opposed by another character or NPC, it's time to roll the dice.

Scaling a sheer rock face to reach the mouth of a titan carcass, swinging your axe at a valravyn, bartering for a better deal on titanbone armor, crafting artifacts, using an ability to alter your appearance, or resisting the effects of poison are all examples of tasks that require rolling a d20.

Climbing the bleached ribs of a titan might be a routine task for a **Hunter** but more difficult for a **Negotiator**, and vice-versa when attempting to de-escalate an encounter with a group of rival titan reapers. A character’s attributes and skills help modify the result of task rolls to increase the chances of hitting the target number.

External factors, such as being knocked prone or receiving help from an ally affect the task difficulty level itself.

## Task Difficulty

The GM assigns a difficulty level to the task that ranges from 0 to 10. This difficulty number represents how challenging the task is to accomplish, with 0 being trivial and 10 being nearly impossible. 

The difficulty level assigned to the task corresponds to a target number. Your d20 roll, plus or minus bonuses, must meet or exceed the target number to succeed at a given task. Each level represents a measured increase in complexity, risk, or required expertise.

### Task Difficulty Table

| Difficulty | Description | Target No. | Guidance                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | Trivial     | 0          | Tasks so simple even a essence-addled wretch could do them. Walking, breathing, basic communication. No roll needed unless severely impaired.       |
| 1          | Easy        | 3          | Basic tasks any reaper learns day one. Climbing a knotted rope, identifying common essence types, maintaining your gear.                            |
| 2          | Simple      | 6          | Tasks requiring some focus but nothing special. Tracking obvious prey, bartering with honest merchants, treating minor wounds.                      |
| 3          | Standard    | 9          | The bread and butter of reaping work. Scaling a titan's weathered bones, fighting routine threats, navigating marked titan veins.                   |
| 4          | Challenging | 12         | Tasks that separate the professionals from the dead. Complex extractions, crafting basic artifacts, surviving moderate corruption exposure.         |
| 5          | Difficult   | 15         | Actions that make veteran reapers pause. Fighting multiple threats, navigating unmapped titan anatomy, resisting serious corruption.                |
| 6          | Daunting    | 18         | Tasks that would make most reapers walk away. Crafting powerful artifacts, maintaining sanity in the thrall of a titan's malevolent spirit.         |
| 7          | Formidable  | 21         | The stuff of reaper legends.                                                                                                                        |
| 8          | Titanic     | 24         | Achievements worthy of enclave records.                                                                                                             |
| 9          | Futile      | 27         | The realm of madmen and heroes. The kind of tasks that end up in death or glory. Usually both.                                                      |
| 10         | Impossible  | 30         | They say before the Fall, the titans themselves would have struggled with this. Tasks beyond mortal capability without extraordinary circumstances. |

## Favor and Folly

**Favors** and **Follies** are temporary circumstances that affect the difficulty of the task itself.

A Favor is any circumstance that makes a task easier to accomplish. This could be having the right tools, good lighting, a stable platform to work from, or assistance from an ally. Each Favor adds a d6 Favor Die to your roll. When you have multiple Favor Dice, roll multiple d6s and add the highest result to your d20 roll.

A Folly is any circumstance that makes a task harder to accomplish. This might include poor lighting, unstable footing, inadequate tools, or interference from enemies. Each Folly increases the difficulty of the task by one step. Each Folly adds a d6 Folly Die to your roll. When you have multiple Folly Dice, roll multiple d6s and subtract the highest result from your d20 roll.

Favors and Follies cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis before rolling. For example, if you have three Favors and two Follies, you would roll one d6 as a Favor.

Favors can come from:
- Help from an ally
- Special abilities that grant Favors under specific conditions
- Equipment or other special objects
- Tactical advantages
- Advantages gained from Fortuitous Rolls

Follies are typically imposed by:
- Complications introduced by the GM
- Damage track conditions
- Environmental hazards established in the scene
- Enemy abilities

For example, a titan reaper is attempting to extract essence from a particularly difficult titan (difficulty 5). The base target number for a titan of this size is thus 15. They have a special Marrow Drill that grants a Favor on drilling tasks, another Favor from rolling a 19 on the Dowsing task, and a third Favor from an ally's assistance. The GM introduces a complication from *Marrowmaw Burrowers* disrupting the site, imposing 1 Folly. After canceling one Favor against the Folly, the reaper rolls 1d20 plus two Favor dice (roll 2d6 and add the highest result) against the target number of 15. They get an 11 on their d20 roll. The two favor dice come up 2 and 5. They add the 5 to their roll for a final result of 16, exceeding the target number and succeeding in the drilling task.

## Fortuitous Rolls

Sometimes, fate takes a more dramatic turn—for the better, or worse. When a d20 roll comes up with a 1 or a 20, unexpected turns of events occur, manifesting as short-term advantages or disadvantages.

### Advantages

When you roll a natural 20 on a dice roll, your character gains an unexpected short-term advantage. Choose from one of the following:

**Damage**: Your attack was especially effective. Roll your damage dice again and take the higher amount. 
**Help**: Whatever you did aids one of your allies with their next task. Choose one ally: they gain 1 Folly on their next task.
**Insight**: You gain a flash of understanding about the situation. With the GM’s approval, learn one hidden detail, weakness, or opportunity relevant to the current scene.
**Momentum**: Your success carries forward. You gain 1 Favor on your next task if attempted within the same scene.
**Essence Surge**: You tap into a hidden reservoir of power. Gain 1 essence point immediately (up to your maximum).
**Influence**: Your action simply provides some positive effect on the scene. This may or may not manifest as a mechanical advantage, but may provide specific advantages or benefits to the narrative.

### Disadvantage

When you roll a natural 1 on a dice roll, your character suffers an unexpected short-term disadvantage. Your character also receives 1 Grit point (See Grit, page XX). The GM chooses one of the following:

**Complication**: Something goes wrong. You gain 1 Folly related to the nature of your failure.
**Essence Leak**: Your connection to titan essence temporarily destabilizes. Lose 1 essence point.
**Influence**: Your action causes some negative effect on the scene. This may or may not manifest as a mechanical disadvantage, but causes some setback to the narrative.

## Combat

The rules of combat follow the same basic task resolution rules. When making an attack against an NPC or creature, the difficulty of the attack roll will be set based on the level of that creature. 

All NPCs and creatures have a level associated with them from 1 to 10. They may have additional modifiers that increase their level in certain areas which may make attacking or defending against NPCs or creatures more difficult than their base level under certain circumstances. For example, the target number for an attack roll made against a level 3 Duskstalker is 9.

When defending against the attacks of NPCs and creatures, player characters make a Defense roll against the attack level of the creature.
### Damage

On a successful attack, the amount of damage is determined by a separate dice roll. The size and number of dice rolled is determined by the type of weapon and attack used. For example, a battleaxe is a medium weapon, which does 1d8 damage. Different types of attacks made by creatures and NPCs also have a damage dice rating associated with them. This is one of the few rolls made by the GM during the game.

### Armor

All player characters, NPCs, and creatures may have an **Armor** rating associated with them. Your armor rating mitigates the amount of points subtracted from your Health Pool when your character takes damage. Player characters get Armor by wearing special equipment like titan-leather armor or titan-bone half plate. 

## Example of Play

The players have delved into a titan carcass in search of rich veins of essence. While performing the *Dowsing* subtask, the GM has introduced a complication: a small group of **Skirling**, which are four-legged chitinous scavengers, have detected their presence. This example begins in the midst of combat as one player engages with the creatures.

> **GM:** The Skirling's bladed limbs catch the dim light as it scuttles across the titan's exposed ribcage towards you. What's your move?
> 
> **Player:** I'm going to try to cleave right through it before it can get close.
> 
> **GM:** Alright, make an attack roll.
> 
> **Player:** My **Vigor** is +1 and I'm trained with Medium Weapons, which gives me an additional +1 so thats a... 12 plus 2 is 14!
>
>*The Skirling is a level 2 creature with no additional bonuses towards physical defense, so a 14 is more than enough against the creature's target number of 6.*
>
> **GM:** Nice, that's a hit! 
> 
> **Player:** My axe is 1d8 damage so that's... 3 points.
> 
> **GM:** The axe bites deep, but the Skirling's still up. Its turn—it lets out a piercing shriek. Give me a **Resolve** roll.
> 
> **Player:** I got a 4…
> 
> **GM:** Oof. That shriek throws you off balance. For the next round, you’re disoriented, giving you 1 Folly. Since it’s shriek succeeded, it gets to make an attack on you. It swings one of it’s razor sharp blade arms in your direction. Make a dodge roll.
> 
> **Player**: My **Precision** is -1.. I rolled an 11 minus 1, so 10 total.
> 
> **Skirlings attack with their bladed appendages at level 3, so the base target number is a 9. But since the character has 1 Folly from being disoriented, their dodge roll is impeded by an additional level, adjusting the target number to 12.** 
> 
> **GM**: Unfortunately, with the ringing in your ears, you lose your footing, and the Skirling’s bladed limb slams into you, reverberating against your armor. You take… 5 points of damage.   
> 
> **Player:** Could've been worse. With my 2 Armor that’s only 3 points.


## Using This Book

This book is designed to be a comprehensive guide for both players and Game Masters. Here's how different groups should approach using it:

### For Players
- Follow Part 2: Titan Reaper to create you character
- Read Chapter 12: Character Advancement to understand how your character improves over time
- Familiarize yourself with Part 3: Rules of the Game

### For Game Masters

Characters in the world of Eldraia are known as **titan reapers**. Titan reapers are the brave, or perhaps desperate, souls who venture into varied and dangerous wastelands teeming with essence-corrupted flora and fauna to harvest titan essence, the veritable fuel of the new and broken world.

While a titan reaper's occupation is to, well, *reap* essence from titans, characters themselves are as wide and varied as the shattered landscapes they traverse. Some are driven by a thirst for knowledge, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the fallen world. Others are motivated by greed, hoping to amass wealth and power through the trade of essence. Some have no choice, seeing their path as the only one to fulfill their pursuit for vengeance, redemption, or justice. And then there are those who see titan reaping as a means of survival, a way to eke out an existence in a world where the old rules no longer apply.

Regardless of their motivations, all titan reapers share certain traits. They are resilient, adaptable, and possess a certain disregard for danger. They have to be, for the wastelands of Eldraia are unforgiving, and the titans' remains are filled with perils both known and unknown.

Throughout this chapter, we will explain the different aspects and steps to creating your character.

Rules-wise, your character consists of:

**Attributes**: Innate physical and mental capabilities.
**Skills**: Learned knowledge and abilities accumulated over your character’s life.
**Skill Specializations**: Focused expertise in a particular skill niche.
**Temperament**: The core of your character’s personality, which generally shapes *how* they interact with the world around them.
**Background**: Ancestry, heritage, or kind.
**Role**: One of four titan reaping roles: the Hunter, the Savant, the Ward, and the Negotiator. 
**Calling**: What your character does best; their specialty.

## Attributes

Your character's attributes represent their innate physical and mental capabilities. These are the core traits that define your character's potential in various areas. There are six attributes in total: Vigor, Precision, Insight, Resolve, Presence, and Resonance.

During character creation, your character will start with specific attribute values depending on your chosen Role (more on that later).

Each attribute has a value associated with it from 0 to 6. A value of 3 would be considered average for a human. The modifier associated with this rating will be applied to rolls during task resolution.

| Attribute Value | Modifier |
|-----------------|----------|
| 1               | - 2      |
| 2               | - 1      |
| 3               | 0        |
| 4               | + 1      |
| 5               | + 2      |
| 6               | + 3      |

### Vigor

Physical strength, endurance, and overall health. It determines your character's ability to withstand physical hardships, and perform feats of strength.

### Agility

Speed, reflexes, and overall mobility. It determines your character’s swiftness in combat, ability to dodge attacks, and perform acrobatic maneuvers.

### Precision

Dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and fine motor skills. It affects your character's ability to perform delicate tasks, such as extracting essence, crafting items, and aiming ranged weapons.

### Insight

Perception, intuition, and the ability to read people and situations. It influences your character's ability to spot hidden details, sense danger, and understand the motives of others.

### Resolve

Mental fortitude, willpower, and determination. It defines your character's ability to resist mental influence, overcome fear, and push through adversity.

### Presence

Charisma, force of personality, and social influence. It determines your character's ability to lead, persuade, and intimidate others.

### Resonance

Affinity with and understanding of titan essence. It affects your character's ability to sense, manipulate, and resist the effects of essence.

## Skills

Skills represent your character's learned abilities and knowledge. They are the areas of expertise that your character has developed through training, experience, or natural aptitude. Unlike attributes, which are largely innate, skills are acquired and improved over time.

During character creation, you will assign ranks (usually either incapable or trained for a starting character). These ranks reflect your character’s proficiencies and weaknesses. For skills with a rank of **Untrained**, they are typically left of the character’s sheet.

The list of skills provided is not exhaustive, and certain abilities gained from your Role and Calling may introduce new skills. The GM may also allow you to create your own based on your character's unique experiences and training.

The modifier associated with a particular skill’s rank will be applied to rolls associated with that skill.

| Skill Rank | Modifier |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Incapable  | - 3      |
| Untrained  | + 0      |
| Practiced  | + 1      |
| Trained    | + 2      |
| Adept      | + 3      |

- **Incapable**: You are truly inept and find even basic attempts at applying the skill challenging.
- **Untrained**: You can attempt tasks with this skill without penalty, simply relying on natural ability.
- **Practiced**: You’ve picked up some experience and basic proficiency.
- **Trained**: You have formal training or significant experience.
- **Adept**: You have mastered advanced methods for applying your expertise and are more skillful even than those who have trained their whole lives.

### What Makes a Skill?

A good skill should:
- Represent a broad area of expertise, not a single specific action
- Be useful in multiple situations
- Not overlap significantly with other skills
- Be something that can be learned or improved through practice
- Have clear situations where it would be used for task resolution

Good examples:
- "Metalworking"
- “Mechanical Engineering”

### Skill List

- **Awareness**: Noticing details, spotting hidden things, and general perceptiveness.
- **Athletics**: Physical feats like running, jumping, climbing, and swimming.
- **Acrobatics**: Agility, balance, and flexibility.
- **Influence**: Persuading and influencing others.
- **Knowledge**: Understanding of history, culture, science, and the world.
- **Medicine**: Treating wounds, diagnosing illnesses, and providing medical care.
- **Operation**: Using and maintaining mechanical equipment.
- **Stealth**: Moving silently, hiding, and avoiding detection.
- **Survival**: Finding food and water, building shelter, identifying edible plants, tracking, navigating terrain, and general wilderness survival techniques.
- **Close Combat**: Proficiency with unarmed strikes, grappling, and extremely close-range fighting techniques.

- **Heavy Melee**: Proficiency with weapons that rely on momentum and strength like longswords, maces, and battle axes. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Heavy* and *Melee* properties.
- **Polearms**: Proficiency with long-hafted weapons like spears, halberds, and glaives. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Polearm* and *Melee* properties.
- **Light Ranged**: Proficiency with small, quick-firing ranged weapons like throwing knives, darts, and hand crossbows. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Light* and *Ranged* properties.
- **Heavy Ranged**: Proficiency with larger ranged weapons like longbows and heavy crossbows. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Heavy* and *Ranged* properties.
- **Marrow Drilling**: Operating and maintaining marrow drills for essence extraction.
- **Essence Manipulation**: Understanding the properties and effects of essence, as well as actively controlling and shaping it for various effects, from minor alterations to significant transformations.
- **Essence Dowsing**: Detecting and locating sources of essence.
- **Wayfinding**: Navigating and finding the best routes through the wastelands.
- **Occult**: Understanding and interacting with supernatural entities, spirits, and otherworldly phenomena. This includes knowledge of rituals, spiritual traditions, and the ability to communicate with or ward against supernatural beings.
- **Nature**: Understanding, identifying, and interacting with flora, fauna, and natural phenomena, particularly those altered by titan essence. This includes the ability to empathize with, calm, and potentially tame creatures.

- **Physical defense**: Defending against physical attacks.
- **Mental defense**: Resisting mental attacks and influence.
- **Commerce**: Buying, selling, and negotiating deals.
- **Riding**: Riding and handling mounts like skoxen or veldrakes.


## Skill Specializations

Skill specializations represent a focused expertise within a broader skill. Having a specialization is independent of your skill rank, however your character must have at least the *Practiced* rank to have a specialization in that skill.

For example, the skill specialization *Titan History (Knowledge)* gives your character +2 to any task rolls related to recalling knowledge about what the titans were like pre-fall, the names of specific titans and their characteristics, the events leading up to the titan war, historical accounts of their battles, and the impact they had on the world.

Having a skill specialization reflects your character’s particular areas of study, experience, or training. When you apply a specialization to a relevant task, you gain an additional +2 bonus to your roll. Skill specializations can also give narrative “permission” that a character can even attempt a roll. The specialization *Communicate with Spirits (Occult)* would not only grant a +2 bonus when attempting to interact with spiritual entities, but generally would be required to even attempt communication with spirits in the first place. Without this specialization, a character might be able to sense or ward against spirits using the base Occult skill, but actually establishing meaningful communication would be beyond their capabilities.

You may gain skill specializations through your character’s *Role*, *Temperament*, or *Background*, or through character advancement.


## Essence Pool and Pushing Tasks

As a titan reaper, your character has trained to harness the power of titan essence within their own body. This reservoir of energy is represented by the **Essence Pool**. Tapping into this pool allows titan reapers to achieve physical, mental, and arcane feats beyond that of normal humans, even allowing them to reshape reality itself. This Pool can be used to push rolls and increase your chance of success in tasks. Many abilities gained through your character’s Role and Calling also have a base essence cost associated with them.

The Essence Pool starts with a number of points determined by the character’s Role and can be replenished through recovery rolls from either essence motes or essence shards.
### Pushing Tasks with Essence

Points from the Essence Pool can be used to *push* rolls, where your character channels essence from within to enhance their abilities or otherwise invoke change on the world around them to increase their chances at succeeding in their endeavors.

To push a task, 2 additional dice, called **Surge Dice**, are rolled. The value of the highest number rolled is added to the total roll for the task. 

The size of the die rolled is determined by your character’s level and how many essence points are spent. The total surge die rating your character can leverage for any given action is limited to your character level divided by 2, rounded up. For example, a level 3 character can choose to push a single task with level 2 surge dice (2d6), or push two tasks each with level 1 surge dice (2d4) within the same action.

The decision to push a task with essence must be made before the initial task roll.

| Surge Die Level | Character Level | Base Essence Cost | Die Rating |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 1               | 1               | 2                 | 2d4        |
| 2               | 3               | 6                 | 2d6        |
| 3               | 5               | 10                | 2d8        |
| 4               | 8               | 14                | 2d10       |


### Applying Surge Dice to Damage

Your character can also choose to imbue essence into the amount of damage their attacks inflict. Instead of applying the Surge Dice value to the task roll, the value is added as a modifier to your attack's damage instead.

In this case, if you *hit* on an attack roll that was not pushed, you can choose to push your damage roll instead prior to rolling your damage dice.


### Applying Surge Dice to Multiple Tasks

It is not uncommon for character actions to involve multiple tasks (rolls). The most basic example being an attack roll followed by a damage roll. 

When pushing a task that involves multiple rolls, you must decide how to allocate your Surge Dice before making any of the rolls. You can choose to apply the Surge Dice to any or all of the rolls involved in the task, but the total number of essence points spent cannot exceed your character's limit based on their level.

For example, if a level 2 character (who can spend up to 4 essence points on a single task) is making an attack that involves an attack roll and a damage roll, they could choose to spend 2 essence points to push the attack roll (rolling 2d4 and adding the highest value to the attack roll) and 2 essence points to push the damage roll (rolling 2d4 and adding the highest value to the damage).

Alternatively, they could choose to spend all 4 essence points on the attack roll (rolling 2d6) and none on the damage roll, or vice versa.

The key point is that the allocation of Surge Dice must be decided before any rolls are made, and the total essence points spent must not exceed the character's per-task limit.

This system allows for strategic decisions and risk-reward calculations. Do you spend all your essence on making sure you hit, or do you save some for a potentially devastating damage roll? The choice is yours, but choose wisely, as essence is a limited resource.

Remember, once you've allocated your Surge Dice and made your rolls, you can't go back and change your decision. The essence is spent, and the results are final. This is the risk and reward of channeling the raw power of titan essence - it can lead to incredible feats, but it can also leave you drained and vulnerable if things don't go as planned.


## Health and Wounds

The line between life and death is a thin one. Titan reapers face constant danger, whether from the corrupted creatures that roam the wastelands or the hazards of essence extraction itself. To reflect this, we use a two-part system for tracking character health: **Health Pool** and the **Damage Track**.

### Health Pool

Your health points represent your character's ability to avoid serious injury through a combination of skill, luck, and resilience. Rather than representing actual physical wounds, health points indicate your character's capacity to turn lethal blows into minor scrapes, dodge at the last second, or otherwise avoid taking serious damage.

Your character’s maximum health is based on the following:

**10 + Vigor Value + Resolve Value + Additional Modifiers**.

Additional modifiers includes any bonuses (or penalties) to your health pool that may be specifically noted in your character’s Nature or Background.

### The Damage Track

The Damage Track represents serious physical and mental harm to your character. Titan reapers are hardened adventurers, and as their situation becomes more dire, they often find that the adrenaline and motivation to survive allows them to tap into reserves of strength they didn’t know they had. Each step on the Damage track has a **Drawback**, but also one **Desperate Advantage** of your choice.

When your character’s Health Pool reaches 0 points, your character:

1. Moves one step down on the damage track
2. Regain points in your Health Pool equal to your Vigor score (minimum of 2).
3. Remove any existing **Drawback** and **Desperate Advantage**.
4. Choose your character’s **Desperate Advantage**.

Certain enemies can also affect your character’s Damage Track directly.

The Damage Track has five states: **Healthy**, **Bloodied**, **Battered**, and **Dead**.

#### Healthy

No significant injuries or ailments. No **Drawback** or **Desperate Advantage**.

#### Bloodied

A **Bloodied** character has accumulated enough scrapes and bruises to significantly impact their performance. They're hurting, but still very much in the fight.

**Drawback**: All tasks are rolled with at least 1 **Folly**.
**Desperate Advantage**: Pick one:
- Once per scene, you can push a task without spending essence points (using surge dice based on your current level).
- Your attacks deal +2 damage
- Reduce all essence costs by 1 point (minimum of 1)
- Gain temporary essence points equal to your **Resonance** score.
- Gain 1 **Favor** on all attack rolls.
- When you push a task, re-roll the d20 at take the higher result.

#### Battered

A **Battered** character has sustained serious injuries that threaten their life. They're running on pure adrenaline and determination.

**Drawback**: All tasks are rolled with 2 **Folly**, and all tasks except for moving an immediate distance require a minimum investment of 1 essence point (even basic tasks that don’t normally require essence).

**Desperate Advantage**: Pick one:
- Once per scene, you can choose to treat a failed roll as a success instead
- Your attacks deal +4 damage
- Reduce all essence costs by 2 points (minimum of 1)
- Gain 2 **Favor** on all attack rolls
- When you push a task, step the Surge Die rating up by 1
- When you take damage, you can spend essence points to reduce the incoming damage by an equal amount up to your **Vigor** or **Resolve** score (depending on the type of damage taken)

#### Dead

Dead is dead.

## Grit

> If you want to be a reaper, you’ve got to have grit. One moment, you you’ve had a big score and are feelin’ tall as the titans, but the wastelands have a funny way of tearing you a new one just out of spite.

Every titan reaper has grit. They have to in order to survive their ordeals. To push past their failures, get back up and persevere, and reapers have a knack for turning their luck around just when it seems to be heading for the worst.

For every natural 1 your character rolls on a task roll, your character receives 1 Grit point. There is no limit on the amount of Grit you can hold, however it’s best to use it freely—another failure is always around the corner. Grit points persist between sessions, and characters always start a new session with at least 1 Grit.

### Spending Grit

Grit can be spent in various ways to turn the tide in your favor. Whether it’s pushing through a difficult situation, narrowly avoiding a death blow, or tipping the odds in your favor, girt represents your character’s ability to use failure to their advantage.

**Push Through**: Spend *1 Grit* to re-roll any failed task and choose which result to take. This includes rolls you didn’t make!
**Near Miss**: After an enemies attack hits, spend *1 Grit* to reduce the damage taken by half, rounded up.
**Reaper’s Favor**: Spend *2 Grit* to gain a *Favor* for the duration of the scene. The Favor should be related to the details of the scene. For example, a Negotiator realizes that the leader of the Enclave is actually an old acquaintance, granting them a Favor die on all social interaction tasks with the leader for the remainder of the scene.
**Player Twists**: Each character’s Role gives them access to three *Player Twists*, which are abilities tied to their Role that allow them to alter the story in some way to their benefit. These abilities can be activated by spending *1 Grit*.

# Rules of the Game

Titan Reapers often find themselves in the midst of conflict. Caught between rival factions, surviving in the dangerous wilds, negotiating with powerful enclave leaders, delving into abandoned enclaves, or warding off essence-corrupted creatures while harvesting from a titan's heart chamber are just a few examples of the high-stakes and perilous situations they face. This chapter covers the core rules for resolving these encounters and more.

## Scenes and Turns



## Recovering Health


## Recovering Essence

Titan reapers can recover essence into their essence pool by siphoning essence from essence shards, or absorbing raw essence motes directly. This task utilizes rolling a d6 to determine the amount of essence recovered.
### Recovering Essence

After expending points from their essence pool, titan reapers can recover those points by siphoning energy from refined essence shards or directly from raw essence motes. This process is similar to resting to recover points in Might, Speed, and Intellect pools.

When you rest to recover essence, make an essence recovery roll. To do this, roll a d6 and add your tier. You recover that many points in your essence pool, which you can use to fuel your abilities.

Each character decides when to make essence recovery rolls. Recovering essence always takes one action, no matter how many essence recovery rolls you’ve made in a day. However, each recovery roll made within a 24 hour period incurs a corruption resistance roll, which increases in difficulty for each roll made within the same day.

#### Recovery Roll Costs

When making an essence recovery roll, players must declare which resource they are using to recover essence before making their recovery roll. Certain resources, such as higher denominations of essence shards or special sources of titan essence, give additional bonuses to the recovery roll.

| Resource | Bonus to Recovery Roll | Usage Cost |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Skor     | +0                     | 10         |
| Dram     | +0                     | 1          |
| Keld     | +3                     | 1          |
| Orin     | +6                     | 1          |
| Raw Mote | +0                     | 1          |

### Essence Recovery Example

Kael, a seasoned Savant of the third tier, is currently escaping the depths of a gargantuan titan carcass with his crew. With only 3 points remaining in his essence pool, he decides to make an essence recovery roll to prepare for the potential dangers that lurk as they make their egress.

Kael has several options for recovery, but he chooses to use a dram of refined essence, which is the most readily available resource in his possession. A dram doesn't provide any additional bonus to his recovery roll, but it's enough for his needs at the moment.

As Kael focuses on the dram, he begins the delicate process of siphoning its energy. He rolls a d6 and gets a 4. Since he is at tier 3, he adds his tier to the roll for a total recovery of 7 points (4 + 3 = 7). Kael's essence pool increases by 7 points, providing him with much-needed resources for his abilities.

However, using titan essence is not without risk. Kael must now make an Intellect defense roll against essence corruption. This is his third recovery roll of the day, so the difficulty is 3 (Base 2 + 1 for each recovery roll). Kael rolls a 15, successfully resisting the essence corruption and avoiding the potential complications that could arise.

## Essence Corruption

Essence Corruption is a peril that looms over every titan reaper. Prolonged exposure to titan essence can have profound effects on the physical and mental well-being of individuals. The line between mastering titan essence and falling prey to its corrupting influence is a precarious one, and reapers must tread carefully to avoid succumbing to its insidious effects.

### Signs of Corruption

The symptoms of essence corruption vary from individual to individual, but common manifestations include physical mutations, psychological disturbances, and an insatiable hunger for more essence. These signs are often progressive and can worsen with sustained exposure.

**Physical Mutations**: Reapers may exhibit abnormal growths, changes in skin color or texture, or even elemental manifestations such as sparks of electricity or a faint glow emanating from their bodies.

**Psychological Disturbances**: Mental instability can manifest as paranoia, mood swings, hallucinations, or an obsession with acquiring more essence at any cost.

**Essence Cravings**: A craving for essence that becomes increasingly difficult to control, leading to risky behavior or desperate acts to obtain more.

### Corruption Progression

As corruption progresses, it becomes increasingly challenging to reverse its effects. Reapers must be vigilant in monitoring their own well-being and that of their fellow reapers. Left unchecked, severe corruption can lead to irreversible physical deformities, mental deterioration, and an eventual descent into madness.

### Resisting Corruption

The first time a player recovers essence in a day, resisting essence corruption is a difficulty 0 Intellect task. If they recover essence again within the same 24-hour period, each subsequent recovery within the same day increases the difficulty by 1.

After three consecutive successful rolls against resisting corruption, players may move down a level of the corruption track, but any effects they have are permanent (unless otherwise stated).

### Corruption Track

##### Unaffected
No notable effects.

#### Tinged
Slight overuse of titan essence may cause minor physical or mental aberrations to manifest. Characters that gain this condition must roll on the [[#Tinged Effects Table|Tinged Effects Table]] to gain a minor physical or mental mutation.

Additionally, while a character has the **tinged** condition:

 -  You gain +2 to your Essence Pool recovery rolls

#### Touched
Repeated exposure to titan essence at this level starts to impact the character's physiology and psyche more heavily. Characters that gain the **touched** condition must roll on the [[#Touched Effects Table|Touched Effects Table]] to gain a more pronounced mutation.

In addition to the effects of being **tinged**:

 - You suffer a -1 penalty to all Might and Speed recovery rolls as your body finds it difficult to recuperate.
 - You Essence pool increases by 5 points

#### Afflicted
At this stage, corruption becomes hazardous not only to the reaper but also to those around them. Characters that gain the **afflicted** condition must roll on the [[#Afflicted Effects Table|Afflicted Effects Table]] for a severe aberration.

In addition to the effects of being **touched**:

 - All abilities that use essence cost an additional 2 Essence points.
 - All tasks and abilities involving titan essence are eased by two steps.

#### Eclipsed
The final stage of corruption is when you have been entirely consumed by titan essence. At this point, you've lost almost all semblance of your former self, both physically and mentally. Characters that reach an **eclipsed** condition have become part of the enduring legacy of the titans—a cautionary tale for future reapers.

In addition to the effects of being **afflicted**:

 - All tasks involving social interaction are hindered by two steps
 - Your Essence Pool increases by 10 points
 - Ignore Might, Intellect, and Speed costs for abilities that use Essence points
 - You can no longer speak in languages that any living person understands
 - You no longer need to roll to recover Essence points. At will, you may recover titan essence from motes or titan shards for the full 6 points plus additional modifiers.
 - You no longer need to make rolls to resist Essence Corruption
 - For every 24 hours you remain in the Eclipsed condition, make an Intellect defense roll to remain lucid and in control of your character. This starts at a difficulty 4 task and increases by 1 for each 24 hour period. Upon failure, your character has lost all semblance of humanity and becomes unrecoverable.

### Mitigating and Treating Corruption

Recovering from essence corruption is difficult but not impossible. Below are methods by which reapers can attempt to reduce their level on the corruption track:

- **Purification Rituals**: Participating in enclave-sanctioned rituals can cleanse one's body and mind of some corruption, although these rituals are often costly and require rare ingredients.
- **Essence Fasting**: A prolonged period without using titan essence can gradually reduce corruption levels, though it comes with its own risks, such as withdrawal symptoms and reduced ability to use one's powers.
- **Arcane Therapies**: Through research and experimentation, enclaves have developed therapies that target essence corruption. However, these therapies are experimental at best, with varying degrees of success.
- **Artifacts**: Certain items or artifacts have been known to counteract or mitigate essence corruption. These relics are rare and highly sought after, often requiring perilous quests to obtain.

### Corruption Effects Tables

The following tables outline potential effects for each level of the corruption track. Players roll a d20 to determine the manifestation of their corruption. Some effects may be temporary, while others might become permanent fixtures of a character's journey.

| 11   | Your eyes turn pitch black, allowing you to see in complete darkness, but you become extremely sensitive to bright light.                                     |     |
| 12   | One of your limbs becomes ghostly and translucent, allowing it to pass through solid objects at will.                                                         |     |

| 17   | You inadvertantly siphon essence from objects around you.                                                                                                     |     |

| 6    | Your gaze can petrify living creatures, leaving them frozen in a state between life and death.                                                                                                 |
| 7    | The titan essence within you fossilized, growing from your skin into sharp, crystalline formations, painfully sharp and unbreakable.                                                           |
| 8    | The spirits of the dead are drawn to you, whispering secrets and begging for release.                                                                                                          |
| 9    | An aura of cold darkness envelops you, extinguishing light sources and chilling the bones of those nearby.                                                                                     |
| 10   | Your heartbeat synchronizes with the nearest titan’s pulse, drawing you to it.                                                                                                                 |
| 11   | The ground beneath your feet crackles with energy, causing fissures to form and release tendrils of raw essence that writhe like serpents.                                                     |
| 12   | Your touch infuses life into inanimate objects, causing them to animate and serve your will for a limited time before crumbling into dust.                                                     |
| 13   | Your form becomes a swirling vortex of essence, making it difficult for others to perceive you clearly.                                                                                        |
| 14   | At random intervals, your body leaves an echo, duplicating itself for a few moments before the copy dissolves into essence vapor.                                                              |
| 15   | Your entire body becomes semi-transparent, revealing a swirling galaxy of essence within.                                                                                                      |
| 16   | Normal food turns to ash in your mouth; you subsist solely on raw titan essence, which you crave above all else.                                                                               |
| 17   | Anything you touch may randomly transmute into something else—stone to water, metal to dust—as if reality struggles to maintain consistency around you.                                        | 
| 18   | Your flesh and bone is disintegrated as essence consumes your body entirely, leaving your soul bound to a body of fossilized essence                                                           |
| 19   | Your mere presence accelerates entropy in nearby objects, causing them to decay or rust within minutes instead of years.                                                                       |
| 20   | Reality around you fractures; illusions and nightmarish landscapes overlay the world                                                                                                           |

### GM Considerations for Corruption Effects

GMs should use the corruption effects as a way to enhance the narrative and character development within the game. While these effects can provide interesting role-playing opportunities and challenges, GMs should also be mindful of player comfort and boundaries. It's important to discuss with players how they feel about potential body horror or psychological elements and adjust the game accordingly.

Corruption effects should be more than just cosmetic changes—they should have tangible impacts on gameplay and character interactions. For instance, a character with glowing veins might be easier to spot in stealth situations, while one who hears titan thoughts could gain insight into ancient mysteries or even receive cryptic warnings of future events.

The progression of corruption should feel like a natural consequence of a character's actions within the world of Eldraia, rather than a random punishment. Encourage players to explore ways their characters might deal with their corruption, whether through seeking cures, embracing their new abilities, or struggling against the changes to their identities.

Finally, GMs should consider how corruption can tie into larger plot points or themes within the campaign. Perhaps an enclave seeks a cure for corruption that drives the party on a quest, or a rival faction uses corrupted individuals as living weapons.
