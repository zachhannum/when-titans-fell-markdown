# Introduction

**Long ago, titans roamed the land**. Massive creatures of unimaginable power whose vast shadows covered entire cities, and whose steps shook the foundation of the land beneath them. These titans were the gods of old, beings of immense strength and wisdom, whose existence shaped the very fabric of reality.

For eons, these titans ruled over Eldraia, a world teeming with life and magic. They were worshipped as divine beings, their every action said to shape the destiny of the world. But this is not their story. This is the story of what came after.

No one living knows why, but a cataclysmic war erupted amongst the titans. A war so devastating that their mutual destruction was all but inevitable. The world trembled, and the land was razed, reduced to ash.

When the dust settled and silence filled the air once more, Eldraia was forever changed. The titans lay lifeless on the ground—fallen gods reduced to nothing more than colossal carcasses strewn across the landscape.

The impact of their deaths was felt throughout Eldraia. The once vibrant world now lay in ruin—a desolate wasteland where darkness reigned supreme. The skies were eternally shrouded in gloom, pierced only by occasional bursts of eerie light from cracks in reality itself.

But even in death, the titans left behind remnants of their power—titan essence. This essence permeated their decaying bodies and seeped into the very fabric of Eldraia. It became a source of incredible power, coveted by the surviving inhabitants of a shattered world.

**Over a hundred years ago**, humanity emerged from their underground shelters to reclaim the surface. They discovered the latent power within the titan remains, and this newfound resource revolutionized human civilization.

From the ashes of civilization, new factions have emerged, each vying for control over the titan essence. The Slyphir wish to gather as much knowledge and essence as possible, hoarding it for their own research. The Order of the Ivory Eye sees it as a path to ascension and godhood. The Pact simply wish to use it to restore order to the lawless wastelands.

It is within this bleak and treacherous world that you find yourself—a **titan reaper**, one who ventures into the decaying husks of the fallen titans in search of their essence. Equipped with specialized tools and ancient knowledge, you navigate the labyrinthine interior of these colossal carcasses, facing dangers at every turn.

Titan reaping is not for the faint of heart. Locations of titan falls often form complex ecosystems of dangerous flora and fauna, creatures that have adapted and specialized in feeding off the essence themselves, not to mention rival Titan Reapers.

The task is dangerous, and in order to withstand the trials of reaping, titan reapers have adapted to harnessing the power of essence themselves, enhancing their abilities and granting them unique skills. But with great power comes great risk. Improper extraction or overexposure to essence can lead to physical mutations, mental instability, and a condition known as essence corruption.

## Titan Essence

Titan reapers work with essence in its various forms. Raw essence motes must be handled carefully. It’s unrefined form is volatile and acts almost as a living thing.

In this state, titan reapers can use it to enhance their own abilities, craft artifacts, or further refine essence for additional use as currency.

Titan essence is used for nearly everything in this world, and titan reapers stand at the fulcrum and must balance their own need for it against the greater need. Prolific titan reapers tow the line between survival and excess, as the more essence they harvest and use, the greater their risk of corruption. Many a seasoned reaper has succumbed to the allure of power, their bodies and minds twisted by overexposure until they become something no longer recognizably human.

## The World That Remains

After the death of the titans, Eldraia fell into an eternal twilight. The skies became perpetually overcast, and a thick fog settled upon the land, obscuring vision and muffling sound. This mysterious phenomenon is simply known as the **Dusk**.

In order to survive, pockets of humanity banded together to form underground cities known as **enclaves**. These enclaves are hidden beneath layers of rock and debris, offering protection against the dangers that lurk on the surface.

Each enclave has its own unique culture and society. Some enclaves focus on scientific advancements and technological innovation, while others embrace arcane arts and ancient rituals passed down through generations.

The landscape of Eldraia is now dominated by the massive corpses of the fallen titans. These colossal remains, known as "titan falls," have become both landmarks and dangerous frontiers. Some titan falls have become the foundations for settlements, with communities building directly into or around the massive cadavers. Others remain unexplored, their depths holding untold treasures and horrors.

Enclave dwellers have become adept at repurposing titan essence for various uses within their communities. It powers everything from arcane devices that provide energy to life-support systems that sustain their subterranean existence.

The death of the titans unleashed a wave of rapid evolution upon Eldraia's ecosystems. The essence that once flowed through the titan's veins has seeped into the surrounding environment, giving birth to an assortment of dangerous creatures range from grotesque abominations to cunning predators. Some have adapted to the harsh conditions of Eldraia, developing unique abilities and survival tactics. Others have been driven mad by the essence, their once noble forms twisted into horrifying visages.

**Titanborn** creatures are a constant threat to those who venture beyond the safety of the enclaves.

### Factions

In Eldraia, power is not solely wielded by individuals—it is also concentrated within factions that vie for control over titan essence. While there are many factions across all of Eldraia, here are a few of the largest.

- **The Order of the Ivory Eye**: Consider the Titans, even in their fallen state, to be divine. They believe that by harnessing the power of titan essence, they can ascend to godhood themselves. They seek to gather as much essence as possible, using it to enhance their own abilities and unlock ancient rituals of immense power.
- **The Brimstone Syndicate**: Is a ruthless group that seeks to control the flow of titan essence for their own gain. They are known for their brutal tactics and willingness to eliminate anyone who stands in their way.
- **The Sylphir**: Seekers of knowledge above all else, they delve deep into forbidden magics and ancient texts in their quest for understanding and power.
- **The Pact**: A coalition of enclaves seeking to restore order to the lawless wastelands, they believe that by uniting under a common banner, humanity can reclaim its lost glory.

As a titan reaper, you are not bound to any single faction. You may align yourself with a faction's cause or remain independent, navigating the complex web of alliances and rivalries that shape Eldraia's political landscape.

# Primer

Like most tabletop RPGs, your character's success at various tasks is determined through a combination of their capabilities (attributes, skills, abilities), external circumstances, and luck.. The game primarily uses a twenty-sided die (d20) for resolving actions, with your character's relevant attribute modifier and skill training adding to the roll.

What sets titan reapers apart is the essence system. Your character can push beyond normal human limits by channeling essence—the mysterious energy harvested from titan remains. By spending points from your **Essence Pool**, you can add **Surge Dice** to improve your chances of success or increase the effectiveness of your actions.

## Dice

What dice do you need?

## Rolling the dice

When your character is attempting to do something in which the success of failure of completing such a task impacts the story in a significant way, or when your character is directly opposed by another character or NPC, it's time to roll the dice.

Scaling a sheer rock face to reach the mouth of a titan carcass, swinging your axe at a valravyn, bartering for a better deal on titanbone armor, crafting artifacts, using an ability to alter your appearance, or resisting the effects of poison are all examples of tasks that require rolling a d20.

Climbing the bleached ribs of a titan might be a routine task for a **Hunter** but more difficult for a **Negotiator**, and vice-versa when attempting to de-escalate an encounter with a group of rival titan reapers. A character’s attributes and skills help modify the result of task rolls to increase the chances of hitting the target number.

External factors, such as being knocked prone or receiving help from an ally affect the task difficulty level itself.

> In this game, *all* task rolls are made by the players. With a few exceptions, the GM does not make any rolls.

## Task Difficulty

The GM assigns a difficulty level to the task that ranges from 0 to 10. This difficulty number represents how challenging the task is to accomplish, with 0 being trivial and 10 being nearly impossible. 

The difficulty level assigned to the task corresponds to a target number. Your d20 roll, plus or minus bonuses, must meet or exceed the target number to succeed at a given task. Each level represents a measured increase in complexity, risk, or required expertise.

### Task Difficulty Table

| Difficulty | Description | Target No. | Guidance                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | Trivial     | 0          | Tasks so simple even a essence-addled wretch could do them. Walking, breathing, basic communication. No roll needed unless severely impaired.       |
| 1          | Easy        | 3          | Basic tasks any reaper learns day one. Climbing a knotted rope, identifying common essence types, maintaining your gear.                            |
| 2          | Simple      | 6          | Tasks requiring some focus but nothing special. Tracking obvious prey, bartering with honest merchants, treating minor wounds.                      |
| 3          | Standard    | 9          | The bread and butter of reaping work. Scaling a titan's weathered bones, fighting routine threats, navigating marked titan veins.                   |
| 4          | Challenging | 12         | Tasks that separate the professionals from the dead. Complex extractions, crafting basic artifacts, surviving moderate corruption exposure.         |
| 5          | Difficult   | 15         | Actions that make veteran reapers pause. Fighting multiple threats, navigating unmapped titan anatomy, resisting serious corruption.                |
| 6          | Daunting    | 18         | Tasks that would make most reapers walk away. Crafting powerful artifacts, maintaining sanity in the thrall of a titan's malevolent spirit.         |
| 7          | Formidable  | 21         | The stuff of reaper legends.                                                                                                                        |
| 8          | Titanic     | 24         | Achievements worthy of enclave records.                                                                                                             |
| 9          | Futile      | 27         | The realm of madmen and heroes. The kind of tasks that end up in death or glory. Usually both.                                                      |
| 10         | Impossible  | 30         | They say before the Fall, the titans themselves would have struggled with this. Tasks beyond mortal capability without extraordinary circumstances. |

## Favor and Folly

**Favors** and **Follies** are temporary circumstances that affect the difficulty of the task itself.

A Favor is any circumstance that makes a task easier to accomplish. This could be having the right tools, good lighting, a stable platform to work from, or assistance from an ally. Each Favor adds a d6 Favor Die to your roll. When you have multiple Favor Dice, roll multiple d6s and add the highest result to your d20 roll.

A Folly is any circumstance that makes a task harder to accomplish. This might include poor lighting, unstable footing, inadequate tools, or interference from enemies. Each Folly increases the difficulty of the task by one step. Each Folly adds a d6 Folly Die to your roll. When you have multiple Folly Dice, roll multiple d6s and subtract the highest result from your d20 roll.

Favors and Follies cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis before rolling. For example, if you have three Favors and two Follies, you would roll one d6 as a Favor.

Favors can come from:
- Help from an ally
- Special abilities that grant Favors under specific conditions
- Equipment or other special objects
- Tactical advantages
- Advantages gained from Fortuitous Rolls

Follies are typically imposed by:
- Complications introduced by the GM
- Damage track conditions
- Environmental hazards established in the scene
- Enemy abilities

For example, a titan reaper is attempting to extract essence from a particularly difficult titan (difficulty 5). The base target number for a titan of this size is thus 15. They have a special Marrow Drill that grants a Favor on drilling tasks, another Favor from rolling a 19 on the Dowsing task, and a third Favor from an ally's assistance. The GM introduces a complication from *Marrowmaw Burrowers* disrupting the site, imposing 1 Folly. After canceling one Favor against the Folly, the reaper rolls 1d20 plus two Favor dice (roll 2d6 and add the highest result) against the target number of 15. They get an 11 on their d20 roll. The two favor dice come up 2 and 5. They add the 5 to their roll for a final result of 16, exceeding the target number and succeeding in the drilling task.

## Fortuitous Rolls

Sometimes, fate takes a more dramatic turn—for the better, or worse. When a d20 roll comes up with a 1 or a 20, unexpected turns of events occur, manifesting as short-term advantages or disadvantages.

### Advantages

When you roll a natural 20 on a dice roll, your character gains an unexpected short-term advantage. Choose from one of the following:

**Damage**: Your attack was especially effective. Roll your damage dice again and take the higher amount. 
**Help**: Whatever you did aids one of your allies with their next task. Choose one ally: they gain 1 Folly on their next task.
**Insight**: You gain a flash of understanding about the situation. With the GM’s approval, learn one hidden detail, weakness, or opportunity relevant to the current scene.
**Momentum**: Your success carries forward. You gain 1 Favor on your next task if attempted within the same scene.
**Essence Surge**: You tap into a hidden reservoir of power. Gain 1 essence point immediately (up to your maximum).
**Influence**: Your action simply provides some positive effect on the scene. This may or may not manifest as a mechanical advantage, but may provide specific advantages or benefits to the narrative.

### Disadvantage

When you roll a natural 1 on a dice roll, your character suffers an unexpected short-term disadvantage. Your character also receives 1 Grit point (See Grit, page XX). The GM chooses one of the following:

**Complication**: Something goes wrong. You gain 1 Folly related to the nature of your failure.
**Essence Leak**: Your connection to titan essence temporarily destabilizes. Lose 1 essence point.
**Influence**: Your action causes some negative effect on the scene. This may or may not manifest as a mechanical disadvantage, but causes some setback to the narrative.

## Combat

The rules of combat follow the same basic task resolution rules. When making an attack against an NPC or creature, the difficulty of the attack roll will be set based on the level of that creature. 

All NPCs and creatures have a level associated with them from 1 to 10. They may have additional modifiers that increase their level in certain areas which may make attacking or defending against NPCs or creatures more difficult than their base level under certain circumstances. For example, the target number for an attack roll made against a level 3 Duskstalker is 9.

When defending against the attacks of NPCs and creatures, player characters make a Defense roll against the attack level of the creature.
### Damage

On a successful attack, the amount of damage is determined by a separate dice roll. The size and number of dice rolled is determined by the type of weapon and attack used. For example, a battleaxe is a medium weapon, which does 1d8 damage. Different types of attacks made by creatures and NPCs also have a damage dice rating associated with them. This is one of the few rolls made by the GM during the game.

### Armor

All player characters, NPCs, and creatures may have an **Armor** rating associated with them. Your armor rating mitigates the amount of points subtracted from your Health Pool when your character takes damage. Player characters get Armor by wearing special equipment like titan-leather armor or titan-bone half plate. 

## Example of Play

The players have delved into a titan carcass in search of rich veins of essence. While performing the *Dowsing* subtask, the GM has introduced a complication: a small group of **Skirling**, which are four-legged chitinous scavengers, have detected their presence. This example begins in the midst of combat as one player engages with the creatures.

> **GM:** The Skirling's bladed limbs catch the dim light as it scuttles across the titan's exposed ribcage towards you. What's your move?
> 
> **Player:** I'm going to try to cleave right through it before it can get close.
> 
> **GM:** Alright, make an attack roll.
> 
> **Player:** My **Vigor** is +1 and I'm trained with Medium Weapons, which gives me an additional +1 so thats a... 12 plus 2 is 14!
>
>*The Skirling is a level 2 creature with no additional bonuses towards physical defense, so a 14 is more than enough against the creature's target number of 6.*
>
> **GM:** Nice, that's a hit! 
> 
> **Player:** My axe is 1d8 damage so that's... 3 points.
> 
> **GM:** The axe bites deep, but the Skirling's still up. Its turn—it lets out a piercing shriek. Give me a **Resolve** roll.
> 
> **Player:** I got a 4…
> 
> **GM:** Oof. That shriek throws you off balance. For the next round, you’re disoriented, giving you 1 Folly. Since it’s shriek succeeded, it gets to make an attack on you. It swings one of it’s razor sharp blade arms in your direction. Make a dodge roll.
> 
> **Player**: My **Precision** is -1.. I rolled an 11 minus 1, so 10 total.
> 
> **Skirlings attack with their bladed appendages at level 3, so the base target number is a 9. But since the character has 1 Folly from being disoriented, their dodge roll is impeded by an additional level, adjusting the target number to 12.** 
> 
> **GM**: Unfortunately, with the ringing in your ears, you lose your footing, and the Skirling’s bladed limb slams into you, reverberating against your armor. You take… 5 points of damage.   
> 
> **Player:** Could've been worse. With my 2 Armor that’s only 3 points.

# Character Creation

Characters in the world of Eldraia are known as **titan reapers**. Titan reapers are the brave, or perhaps desperate, souls who venture into varied and dangerous wastelands teeming with essence-corrupted flora and fauna to harvest titan essence, the veritable fuel of the new and broken world.

While a titan reaper's occupation is to, well, *reap* essence from titans, characters themselves are as wide and varied as the shattered landscapes they traverse. Some are driven by a thirst for knowledge, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the fallen world. Others are motivated by greed, hoping to amass wealth and power through the trade of essence. Some have no choice, seeing their path as the only one to fulfill their pursuit for vengeance, redemption, or justice. And then there are those who see titan reaping as a means of survival, a way to eke out an existence in a world where the old rules no longer apply.

Regardless of their motivations, all titan reapers share certain traits. They are resilient, adaptable, and possess a certain disregard for danger. They have to be, for the wastelands of Eldraia are unforgiving, and the titans' remains are filled with perils both known and unknown.

Throughout this chapter, we will explain the different aspects and steps to creating your character.

Rules-wise, your character consists of:

**Attributes**: Innate physical and mental capabilities.
**Skills**: Learned knowledge and abilities accumulated over your character’s life.
**Skill Specializations**: Focused expertise in a particular skill niche.
**Temperament**: The core of your character’s personality, which generally shapes *how* they interact with the world around them.
**Background**: Ancestry, heritage, or kind.
**Role**: One of four titan reaping roles: the Hunter, the Savant, the Ward, and the Negotiator. 
**Calling**: What your character does best; their specialty.

## Attributes

Your character's attributes represent their innate physical and mental capabilities. These are the core traits that define your character's potential in various areas. There are five attributes in total: Vigor, Precision, Resolve, Intellect, and Resonance.

During character creation, your character will start with specific attribute values depending on your chosen Role (more on that later).

Each attribute has a value associated with it from 0 to 6. The modifier associated with this rating will be applied to rolls during task resolution.

| Attribute Value | Modifier |
| --------------- | -------- |
| 0               | - 3      |
| 1               | - 2      |
| 2               | - 1      |
| 3               | 0        |
| 4               | + 1      |
| 5               | + 2      |
| 6               | + 3      |


### Vigor

Physical strength, endurance, and overall health. It determines your character's ability to withstand physical hardships, and perform feats of strength.

### Precision

Dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and fine motor skills. It affects your character's ability to perform delicate tasks, such as extracting essence, crafting items, and aiming ranged weapons.

### Resolve

Mental acuity, willpower, and force of personality. It represents your character’s ability to perceive the world around them, understand and influence others, and resist mental influence.

### Intellect

Reasoning, memory, analytical thinking, and perception. It determines your character's ability to solve complex problems, recall information, understand abstract concepts, and notice details in their environment. 

### Resonance

Affinity with and understanding of titan essence. It affects your character's ability to sense, manipulate, and resist the effects of essence.

## Skills

Skills represent your character's learned abilities and knowledge. They are the areas of expertise that your character has developed through training, experience, or natural aptitude. Unlike attributes, which are largely innate, skills are acquired and improved over time.

During character creation, you will assign ranks (usually either incapable or trained for a starting character). These ranks reflect your character’s proficiencies and weaknesses. For skills with a rank of **Untrained**, they are typically left of the character’s sheet.

The list of skills provided is not exhaustive, and certain abilities gained from your Role and Calling may introduce new skills. The GM may also allow you to create your own based on your character's unique experiences and training.

The modifier associated with a particular skill’s rank will be applied to rolls associated with that skill.

Unless otherwise specified, it is assumed that characters have the *Untrained* rank in a particular skill.

| Skill Rank | Modifier |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Incapable  | - 3      |
| Untrained  | + 0      |
| Practiced  | + 1      |
| Trained    | + 2      |
| Adept      | + 4      |

- **Incapable**: You are truly inept and find even basic attempts at applying the skill challenging.
- **Untrained**: You can attempt tasks with this skill without penalty, simply relying on natural ability.
- **Practiced**: You’ve picked up some experience and basic proficiency.
- **Trained**: You have formal training or significant experience.
- **Adept**: You have mastered advanced methods for applying your expertise and are more skillful even than those who have trained their whole lives.

### Skill List by Attribute

Skills are typically tied to a particular attribute. For instance, *Athletics* typically exercises your character’s *Vigor* attribute, while *Stealth* often relied on *Precision*. The following skill list breaks down each skill as it relates to it’s most likely attribute pairing. These pairings should be used as a general guideline when making rolls for task resolution.

However, this connection is flexible. Players can often make a case for using a different attribute with a skill depending on the context of the situation and how the character is attempting success for a given task. For example, let’s say a character is attempting to use an ancient pre-fall artifact to lift a large mechanical gate to gain access to an underground area, so the GM calls for an *Operation* task roll. While *Operation* is typically paired with the *Precision* attribute, a player may argue that their character is utilizing written information they found that describes how to use the mechanism and thus should use *Intellect*. Or perhaps *Vigor* as they attempt to use “percussive maintenance” in order to coerce the mechanism into working. Generally, these sorts of creative approaches should be encouraged, although the GM may modify the task difficulty depending on the approach taken.


#### Vigor

- **Athletics**: Physical actions like running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and feats of raw strength.
- **Tolerance**: Ability to resist the action of poison, to cope with a dangerous drug, survive infection, or endure pain.
- **Acrobatics**: Agility, balance, and flexibility.
- **Physical Defense**: Defending against physical attacks.
- **Close Combat**: Proficiency with unarmed strikes, grappling, and extremely close-range fighting techniques.
- **Light Melee**: Proficiency with quick, precise weapons like daggers, short swords, and hand axes. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Light* and *Melee* properties.
- **Heavy Melee**: Proficiency with weapons that rely on momentum and strength like longswords, maces, and battle axes. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Heavy* and *Melee* properties.

#### Precision

- **Stealth**: Moving silently, hiding, and avoiding detection.
- **Operation**: Using and maintaining mechanical equipment.
- **Marrow Drilling**: Operating and maintaining marrow drills for essence extraction.
- **Light Ranged**: Proficiency with small, quick-firing ranged weapons like throwing knives, darts, and hand crossbows. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Light* and *Ranged* properties.
- **Sleight of Hand**: Pickpocketing, lock picking, and other feats of manual dexterity.
- **Heavy Ranged**: Proficiency with larger ranged weapons like longbows and heavy crossbows. This skill applies to using weapons with the *Heavy* and *Ranged* properties.
- **Essence Extraction**: Safely extracting essence from titan remains.

#### Resolve

- **Awareness**: Noticing details, spotting hidden things, and general perceptiveness.
- **Persuasion**: Persuading and influencing others through reason, bribes, or other social methods.
- **Intimidation**: Coercing others through threats or force of personality.
- **Insight**: Intuitive sense of others’ true intentions, detecting deception, predicting desires. 
- **Commerce**: Buying, selling, and negotiating deals.
- **Deceit**: Lying, bluffing, and misdirection.
- **Mental defense**: Resisting mental attacks and influence.

#### Intellect

- **Knowledge**: Understanding of history, culture, science, and the world.
- **Medicine**: Treating wounds, diagnosing illnesses, and providing medical care.
- **Survival**: Finding food and water, building shelter, identifying edible plants, tracking, navigating terrain, and general wilderness survival techniques.
- **Wayfinding**: Navigating and finding the best routes through the wastelands.
- **Nature**: Understanding, identifying, and interacting with flora, fauna, and natural phenomena, particularly those altered by titan essence. This includes the ability to empathize with, calm, and potentially tame creatures.
- **Craft**: Creating, repairing, and modifying items and equipment using available materials and tools.

#### Resonance

- **Essence Manipulation**: Understanding the properties and effects of essence, as well as actively controlling and shaping it for various effects, from minor alterations to significant transformations.
- **Essence Dowsing**: Detecting and locating sources of essence.
- **Occult**: Understanding and interacting with supernatural entities, spirits, and otherworldly phenomena. This includes knowledge of rituals, spiritual traditions, and the ability to communicate with or ward against supernatural beings.
- **Resisting Corruption**: Resisting the corrupting effects of essence, particularly when recovering essence.


## Skill Specializations

Skill specializations represent a focused expertise within a broader skill. Having a specialization is independent of your skill rank, however your character must have at least the *Practiced* rank to have a specialization in that skill.

For example, the skill specialization *Titan History (Knowledge)* gives your character +2 to any task rolls related to recalling knowledge about what the titans were like pre-fall, the names of specific titans and their characteristics, the events leading up to the titan war, historical accounts of their battles, and the impact they had on the world.

Having a skill specialization reflects your character’s particular areas of study, experience, or training. When you apply a specialization to a relevant task, you gain an additional +2 bonus to your roll. Skill specializations can also give narrative “permission” that a character can even attempt a roll. The specialization *Communicate with Spirits (Occult)* would not only grant a +2 bonus when attempting to interact with spiritual entities, but generally would be required to even attempt communication with spirits in the first place. Without this specialization, a character might be able to sense or ward against spirits using the base Occult skill, but actually establishing meaningful communication would be beyond their capabilities.

You may gain skill specializations through your character’s *Role*, *Temperament*, or *Background*, or through character advancement.


## Essence Pool and Pushing Tasks

As a titan reaper, your character has trained to harness the power of titan essence within their own body. This reservoir of energy is represented by the **Essence Pool**. Tapping into this pool allows titan reapers to achieve physical, mental, and arcane feats beyond that of normal humans, even allowing them to reshape reality itself. This Pool can be used to push rolls and increase your chance of success in tasks. Many abilities gained through your character’s Role and Calling also have a base essence cost associated with them.

The Essence Pool starts with a number of points determined by the character’s Role and can be replenished through recovery rolls from either essence motes or essence shards.
### Pushing Tasks with Essence

Points from the Essence Pool can be used to *push* rolls, where your character channels essence from within to enhance their abilities or otherwise invoke change on the world around them to increase their chances at succeeding in their endeavors.

To push a task, 2 additional dice, called **Surge Dice**, are rolled. The value of the highest number rolled is added to the total roll for the task. 

The size of the die rolled is determined by your character’s level and how many essence points are spent. The total surge die rating your character can leverage for any given action is limited to your character level divided by 2, rounded up. For example, a level 3 character can choose to push a single task with level 2 surge dice (2d6), or push two tasks each with level 1 surge dice (2d4) within the same action.

The decision to push a task with essence must be made before the initial task roll.

| Surge Die Level | Character Level | Base Essence Cost | Die Rating |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 1               | 1               | 2                 | 2d4        |
| 2               | 3               | 6                 | 2d6        |
| 3               | 5               | 10                | 2d8        |
| 4               | 8               | 14                | 2d10       |


### Applying Surge Dice to Damage

Your character can also choose to imbue essence into the amount of damage their attacks inflict. Instead of applying the Surge Dice value to the task roll, the value is added as a modifier to your attack's damage instead.

In this case, if you *hit* on an attack roll that was not pushed, you can choose to push your damage roll instead prior to rolling your damage dice.


### Applying Surge Dice to Multiple Tasks

It is not uncommon for character actions to involve multiple tasks (rolls). The most basic example being an attack roll followed by a damage roll. 

When pushing a task that involves multiple rolls, you must decide how to allocate your Surge Dice before making any of the rolls. You can choose to apply the Surge Dice to any or all of the rolls involved in the task, but the total number of essence points spent cannot exceed your character's limit based on their level.

For example, if a level 2 character (who can spend up to 4 essence points on a single task) is making an attack that involves an attack roll and a damage roll, they could choose to spend 2 essence points to push the attack roll (rolling 2d4 and adding the highest value to the attack roll) and 2 essence points to push the damage roll (rolling 2d4 and adding the highest value to the damage).

Alternatively, they could choose to spend all 4 essence points on the attack roll (rolling 2d6) and none on the damage roll, or vice versa.

The key point is that the allocation of Surge Dice must be decided before any rolls are made, and the total essence points spent must not exceed the character's per-task limit.

This system allows for strategic decisions and risk-reward calculations. Do you spend all your essence on making sure you hit, or do you save some for a potentially devastating damage roll? The choice is yours, but choose wisely, as essence is a limited resource.

Remember, once you've allocated your Surge Dice and made your rolls, you can't go back and change your decision. The essence is spent, and the results are final. This is the risk and reward of channeling the raw power of titan essence - it can lead to incredible feats, but it can also leave you drained and vulnerable if things don't go as planned.


## Health and Wounds

The line between life and death is a thin one. Titan reapers face constant danger, whether from the corrupted creatures that roam the wastelands or the hazards of essence extraction itself. To reflect this, we use a two-part system for tracking character health: **Health Pool** and the **Damage Track**.

### Health Pool

Your health points represent your character's ability to avoid serious injury through a combination of skill, luck, and resilience. Rather than representing actual physical wounds, health points indicate your character's capacity to turn lethal blows into minor scrapes, dodge at the last second, or otherwise avoid taking serious damage.

Your character’s maximum health is based on the following:

**5 + Vigor Value + Resolve Value + Additional Modifiers**.

Additional modifiers includes any bonuses (or penalties) to your health pool that may be specifically noted in your character’s Nature or Background.

### The Damage Track

The Damage Track represents serious physical and mental harm to your character. Titan reapers are hardened adventurers, and as their situation becomes more dire, they often find that the adrenaline and motivation to survive allows them to tap into reserves of strength they didn’t know they had. Each step on the Damage track has a **Drawback**, but also one **Desperate Advantage** of your choice.

When your character’s Health Pool reaches 0 points, your character:

1. Moves one step down on the damage track
2. Regain points in your Health Pool equal to your Vigor score (minimum of 1).
3. Remove any existing **Drawback** and **Desperate Advantage**.
4. Choose your character’s **Desperate Advantage**.

Certain enemies can also affect your character’s Damage Track directly.

The Damage Track has five states: **Healthy**, **Bloodied**, **Battered**, and **Dead**.

#### Healthy

No significant injuries or ailments. No **Drawback** or **Desperate Advantage**.

#### Bloodied

A **Bloodied** character has accumulated enough scrapes and bruises to significantly impact their performance. They're hurting, but still very much in the fight.

**Drawback**: All tasks are rolled with at least 1 **Folly**.
**Desperate Advantage**: Pick one:
- Once per scene, you can push a task without spending essence points (using surge dice based on your current level).
- Your attacks deal +2 damage
- Reduce all essence costs by 1 point (minimum of 1)
- Gain temporary essence points equal to your **Resonance** score.
- Gain 1 **Favor** on all attack rolls.
- When you push a task, re-roll the d20 at take the higher result.

#### Battered

A **Battered** character has sustained serious injuries that threaten their life. They're running on pure adrenaline and determination.

**Drawback**: All tasks are rolled with 2 **Folly**, and all tasks except for moving an immediate distance require a minimum investment of 1 essence point (even basic tasks that don’t normally require essence).

**Desperate Advantage**: Pick one:
- Once per scene, you can choose to treat a failed roll as a success instead
- Your attacks deal +4 damage
- Reduce all essence costs by 2 points (minimum of 1)
- Gain 2 **Favor** on all attack rolls
- When you push a task, step the Surge Die rating up by 1
- When you take damage, you can spend essence points to reduce the incoming damage by an equal amount up to your **Vigor** or **Resolve** score (depending on the type of damage taken)

#### Dead

Dead is dead.

## Grit

> If you want to be a reaper, you’ve got to have grit. One moment, you you’ve had a big score and are feelin’ tall as the titans, but the wastelands have a funny way of tearing you a new one just out of spite.

Every titan reaper has grit. They have to in order to survive their ordeals. To push past their failures, get back up and persevere, and reapers have a knack for turning their luck around just when it seems to be heading for the worst.

For every natural 1 your character rolls on a task roll, your character receives 1 Grit point. There is no limit on the amount of Grit you can hold, however it’s best to use it freely—another failure is always around the corner. Grit points persist between sessions, and characters always start a new session with at least 1 Grit.

### Spending Grit

Grit can be spent in various ways to turn the tide in your favor. Whether it’s pushing through a difficult situation, narrowly avoiding a death blow, or tipping the odds in your favor, girt represents your character’s ability to use failure to their advantage.

**Push Through**: Spend *1 Grit* to re-roll any failed task and choose which result to take. This includes rolls you didn’t make!
**Near Miss**: After an enemies attack hits, spend *1 Grit* to reduce the damage taken by half, rounded up.
**Reaper’s Favor**: Spend *2 Grit* to gain a *Favor* for the duration of the scene. The Favor should be related to the details of the scene. For example, a Negotiator realizes that the leader of the Enclave is actually an old acquaintance, granting them a Favor die on all social interaction tasks with the leader for the remainder of the scene.
**Player Twists**: Each character’s Role gives them access to three *Player Twists*, which are abilities tied to their Role that allow them to alter the story in some way to their benefit. These abilities can be activated by spending *1 Grit*.

## Nature, Background, Role, and Calling

## Character Level

# Archetype

Character Archetype is a core aspect of your character in When Titans Fell. It defines your character's role, abilities, and strengths within the world of Eldraia. There are four archetypes to choose from: The Hunter, The Savant, The Ward, and The Negotiator.

## The Hunter


> Unseen death. That's what a true Hunter is. You'll never see them until they wish it. By spear or arrow, the method matters not. They know the wind better than you. They know the trees better than you. And sure as the titan's blood they know the titans themselves better than you. If you're out in the wastelands and you get in their way, you best hope they've got bigger prey to track down.


The wastelands of Eldraia are a hard, inhospitable place. But you've survived. Whether by natural born gift or training, you've mastered the elements outside the safety of your Enclave. None are better than you at navigating treacherous landscapes, sniffing out every hint of titan essence, and outmaneuvering the dangerous creatures that lurk in the shadows.

The thrill of the hunt courses through your veins. You revel in it. Be it creature or titan, it is your birthright to track the faintest scent. You are also learned in the methods of extracting titan essence. From dowsing to egress, you possess the hard-won skills at the physical means of reaping titan essence. You excel in studying the anatomy of the titans.

Your natural intuition allows you to be ready for anything out in the wilds.

Hunters in Eldraia can take on many forms. A reclusive outlander who lives off the land and has never stepped foot in an enclave. A renowned slayer of essence-corrupted monsters, infamous throughout the enclaves. Or even someone who travels the lands, studying the various essence-fueled flora and fauna, scribbling notes and sketches into worn leather notebook.

In a titan reaping crew, the Hunter's role is to look out for natural dangers before and during a harvest. Titans and their surrounding areas can be a profuse ecosystem of dangerous creatures, and the Hunter guides the crew safely to and into titan carcasses, and navigates through the ossified mazes of titan innards, finding the most bountiful location for extraction.

Higher-tier Hunters gain a wide breadth of skills and abilities that lend them a diverse toolset. They become more adept and avoiding danger and dealing damage, and overall becoming one of the most versatile titan reaper.

| 10  | Before becoming a titan reaper, you traveled the wastelands as a cartographer, mapping strange and unknown regions twisted by the titans’ war.                                |

| 12  | Long ago, you earned the trust of a reclusive group living in the wastelands who possess unique knowledge about titans and their essence.                                     |
| 13  | A rival factions views you as a threat and has placed a bounty on your head, forcing you to constantly be on the lookout for assassins and spies.                             |
| 14  | You are a wanted fugitive in one of the major enclaves for a crime you did not commit.                                                                                        |
| 15  | You swore an oath to avenge a loved one killed by an essence-mutated beast, driving you to hunt these creatures relentlessly.                                                 |
| 16  | Your extraction skills have attracted the attention of a secretive order that believes essence extracted from titans holds forgotten knowledge.                               |
| 17  | A powerful curse has befallen you as a result of your extensive exposure to titan essence.                                                                                    |
| 18  | While traveling deep in the forest, you awakened a dark and forgotten entity. This being whispers to you promises of power in exchange for titan essence.                     |
| 19  | You owe a blood debt to a wraith whose grave you once desecrated; it demands service in return for mercy.                                                                     |

## The Ward

> Steel nerves and steady hands. When everything goes to shit, you’d better hope you’ve got a Ward between you and the titan-cursed creatures that want to consume your essence and suck out your marrow. Where most would tuck tail and run, they plant their feet and become the barrier between life and death.

Titan reaping is filled with myriad dangers. As a Ward, you are the both the sword and the shield that stands between those perils and your fellow reapers. You have unwavering determination and protective instincts, qualities which make you invaluable to any reaping crew. Whether it’s fending off essence-corrupted monsters, going toe-to-toe with rival factions or reaping parties, stabilizing extraction drills, or ensuring safe passage through treacherous titan remains, you are the backbone of successful extractions.

Wards excel with both hand-to-hand combat and all manner of weaponry. Your prowess on the battlefield makes enemies think twice before challenging you head-on. In addition to your formidable physical abilities, Wards possess innate defenses that further enhance their resilience. You can form protective barriers using titan essence, deflect incoming attacks, or even draw upon essence to rapidly heal wounds.

Your skills as a Ward may have come from a variety of places. A guardian who protects and watches over their enclave. A mercenary or enforcer working for the Brimstone Syndicate. A former gladiator who cut their teeth fighting for entertainment.

Wards excel at defensive tactics and maintaining control in chaotic situations. Your presence alone can turn the tide of a dangerous encounter, as you coordinate with your team to maintain position and protect vital extraction points. Some Wards focus on physical protection through martial prowess, while others learn to manipulate titan essence to create protective barriers and stabilizing fields.

## The Negotiator



In a world where power is often won with words rather than weapons, Negotiators are masters of diplomacy and deceit. As a Negotiator, you navigate the turbulent politics of Eldraia with ease and cunning. You deftly broker alliances, orchestrate intricate deals, and manipulate those around you to ensure your team's survival.

Negotiators excel in social encounters—persuasion, deception, intimidation—these are all tools at your disposal. With keen insight into human nature and societal dynamics coupled with a silver tongue, you are able to diffuse potential conflicts or exploit opportunities for gain.

Beyond their social prowess though, Negotiators who have become titan reapers have learned to infuse their words with titan essence. Some can influence others' emotions or thoughts subtly; others can use it to weave illusions or create convincing disguises.

Your journey as a Negotiator will take you across various enclaves of Eldraia - from thriving underground cities to makeshift settlements in titan remains – each with their own ethos and power structures. Navigating these differing societies without falling foul of their rules (or rulers) will be key in securing valuable resources for extraction missions.

#passive

Your character's Temperament represents their core personality, their fundamental way of being in the world. It's the lens through which they view and interact with everything around them.

The differences between a Charismatic Hunter and a Brutal Hunter are considerable. While both may excel at tracking and taking down their prey, how they approach challenges and interact with others will be fundamentally different. A Charismatic Hunter might rely on their social network and diplomatic skills to gather information, while a Brutal Hunter may prefer direct confrontation and intimidation.

Temperament not only helps shape your view of *how* your character interacts with the world, but also establishes abilities, skill trainings, and modifications to your starting attributes. Your Temperament also may modify your character in a negative way. Some temperaments give your character inabilities—skills with the **incapable** skill rank. A well-rounded and interesting character is defined as much by their limitations as their strengths. Your character’s temperament helps create natural friction points and challenges that drive compelling narratives and memorable moments at the table.

## List of Temperaments

### Brazen

> There's those who wait for the perfect moment, and there's those who make the moment perfect by stabbing it in the face.

You face challenges head-on with unwavering confidence—some might say recklessness. Where others see danger, you see opportunity. The way you see it, there isn’t any other way to survive in such a dangerous world. Maybe you’ve always been this way, or perhaps something happened to you in the past that shaped this mentality. While this bold approach has led to both spectacular successes and dramatic failures, you wouldn't have it any other way.

**Act now, think later**: Increase your *Vigor* value by +1.

### Brutal

> Violence is the only honest trade left. Everything else is just fancy lies we tell ourselves.

You are a force to be reckoned with, embodying raw power and brutal strength. The harsh nature of Eldraia has forged you into a weapon, and you've learned that sometimes the direct approach is the best approach. Whether through necessity or choice, you've embraced your capacity for violence and intimidation. You might not be proud of what you've become, but you understand its necessity in this broken world.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Strength over accuracy**: Increase your *Vigor* value by +2. Decrease your *Precision* value by -1.

### Cautious

> Never take chances. Chances are the currency of fools and gamblers.

You've survived this long by being careful, methodical, and never taking unnecessary risks. While others might call you paranoid, you prefer to think of yourself as prepared. You prefer to avoid unnecessary dangers and make informed decisions based on thorough observation and assessment. In a world where a single mistake can mean death, your cautious nature has kept you alive while watching countless others fall to their own recklessness.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Measured Approach**: Increase your *Intellect* and *Resolve* values by +1. Decrease your *Vigor* value by -2.

### Charismatic

> Why fight when you can talk? Why steal when you can trade? Why make enemies when you can make friends?

You understand that even in this broken world, people are still the most valuable resource. Your natural charm and social intuition have gotten you out of (and sometimes into) more situations than any weapon ever could. Your presence commands attention—people are drawn to you like moths to a flame. You know that a well-placed word can be sharper than any blade.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Social Grace**: Increase your *Resolve* value by +1. Decrease your *Vigor* value by -1.

### Cunning

> Knowledge is power, and power is survival. The trick is knowing which secrets to keep and which to trade.

### Enigmatic

> Reality is more flexible than most realize. You just have to know what threads to pull on.


You are a mystery—a puzzle waiting to be solved. Your true intentions and motivations remain elusive, even to those close to you. Your nature allows you to see patterns others miss and connections that others dismiss as coincidence. Whether through natural insight or exposure to essence, you've developed an almost supernatural understanding of the world's hidden workings. Your perspective often seems strange to others, but your unusual insights have proven invaluable time and time again.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Otherworldly Insight**: Increase your *Resonance* and *Resolve* values by +1. Decrease your *Vigor* and *Precision* values by -1.

**Hidden Knowledge**: You have access to obscure information or secrets that can aid you in your adventures. Once per session, you can ask the GM a question about the current situation or location, and they will provide you with a cryptic clue or hint.

**Skill**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Awareness* and *Occult*.

**Inability**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Persuasion* and *Commerce*.


### Hopeful

> What can we do except try and be better?

In a world defined by loss and struggle, you maintain an unwavering belief in the possibility of a better tomorrow. Your optimism isn't naive—it's a hard-won conviction forged in the fires of adversity. You understand that hope isn't just about believing things will get better; it's about working to make them better, one small victory at a time. Your presence tends to lift the spirits of those around you, making the impossible seem achievable.

### Ill-fated

> Luck? I’ve never had any. My success is my own.

You're cursed, or at least that's what everyone says. Misfortune seems to dog your every step. Despite these setbacks, you have learned to adapt and persevere, finding ways to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds stacked against you. Where others see bad luck, you see opportunity—after all, when things can't get worse, they can only get better. Your uncanny ability to attract trouble has taught you to be resourceful and resilient in ways that luckier folks never learn.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Murphy's Law**: Increase your *Resolve* value by +1. Decrease your *Precision* value by -1.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Operation* and *Stealth*.

### Inquisitive

> Fear and ignorance walk hand in hand. To kill fear, one need only ask the right questions.

Your insatiable curiosity drives you to understand the world around you. Where others see only ruins and danger, you see mysteries to be solved and knowledge to be gained. Your thirst for knowledge knows no bounds, and you will go to great lengths to uncover the secrets hidden within Eldraia's shattered landscapes. This dedication to understanding has given you insights that others miss, though sometimes your curiosity leads you into dangerous situations.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Scholar's Mind**: Increase your *Intellect* value by +1.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Intimidation* and *Physical Defense*.

### Insane

> Don’t worry, out of all the realities I’ve seen, this one is my favorite.

Your mind doesn't work quite like others'. Maybe it was exposure to too much essence, a traumatic encounter with a titan's remains, or perhaps you were born this way. Whatever the cause, your perception of reality is... unique. While others might see this as a weakness, your unusual way of thinking often leads to insights and solutions that "sane" minds would never consider. While your grasp on reality may be tenuous at best, there is an unpredictable power within your madness that can turn the tide of battle or confound your enemies.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Fractured Mind**: Increase your *Resonance* value by +2. Decrease your *Resolve* value by -1.

**Fits of Insight**: Whenever such knowledge is appropriate, the GM feeds you information although there is no clear explanation as to how you could know such a thing. This is up to the GM’s discretion, but it should happen as often as once each session.

**Skills**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Occult* and *Essence Manipulation*.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Mental Defense* and *Wayfinding*.


### Jaded

> There is no good people left in the world. Only those who are already dead, and those still in denial. 

You've seen too much to maintain any illusions about nobility or heroism. The harsh realities of life have stripped away your idealism, leaving behind a pragmatic survivor who understands that everything and everyone has a price. While others might call you cynical, you prefer to think of yourself as realistic. Your emotional detachment allows you to make the hard decisions that others can't.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Hardened Heart**: Increase your *Resolve* and *Vigor* values by +1. Decrease your *Resonance* value by -1.

**Skills**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Mental Defense*, *Insight*, and *Awareness*.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Persuasion*.

### Resourceful

> The difference between a fool and a genius is whether or not it works in practice.

You have an uncanny knack for finding solutions to problems through unconventional means. Where others see junk, you see possibilities. Years of surviving in a resource-scarce world have taught you to be creative with what you have, whether it's cobbling together equipment from salvage or finding unconventional uses for common items. Your ability to improvise and adapt has saved your life more times than you can count.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Adaptable Mind**: Increase your *Intellect* and *Precision* values by +1. Decrease your *Vigor* value by -1.

**Skills**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Craft* and *Operation*.

**Makeshift**: When attempting to craft or repair items with improvised materials, you gain 1 Favor on the roll. Additionally, you can attempt to craft simple items without proper tools, though the GM may increase the difficulty of such attempts.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Knowledge* and *Occult*.

### Scholarly

> A thick book is akin to a thousand blades. Each page may cut just as deeply.

You approach the world through the lens of academic study and methodical observation. While others might see the wastelands as just a dangerous place to survive, you see them as a vast repository of knowledge waiting to be uncovered. Your dedication to learning and understanding drives you to take careful notes, collect specimens, and study the remnants of the world that was. Though some might mock your academic approach, your expertise has proven invaluable in understanding the nature of titans and their essence.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Academic Mind**: Increase your *Intellect* value by +1.

**Field Research**: When you spend at least 10 minutes studying a particular phenomenon, creature, or artifact, you can make a Knowledge roll. On a success, you gain insight that grants you 1 Favor on all related rolls for the remainder of the scene.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Athletics*, *Acrobatics*, and *Persuasion*.

### Stoic

> Emotions cloud judgment. Control yourself, control the situation.

You maintain rigid control over your emotions, viewing them as potential weaknesses that could compromise your judgment. Years of discipline have taught you to approach every situation with calculated precision and unwavering focus. While others might be driven by passion or fear, you rely on logic and measured responses. Your emotional restraint can make you seem cold to others, but it also allows you to remain clear-headed in crisis situations.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Iron Will**: Increase your *Resolve* value by +1.

**Unshakeable**: When you would gain a condition that affects your mental state (fear, confusion, etc.), you can spend 1 essence point to re-roll the task. You must always take the second result.

**Skills**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Mental Defense* and *Physical Defense*.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Persuasion* and *Deceit*.

### Vengeful

> Every scar is a reminder. Every slight, a debt to be paid.

You are driven by an unquenchable thirst for revenge. Whether it's personal loss, betrayal, or a broader sense of injustice, your desire for retribution shapes every decision you make. While this burning hatred might seem destructive to others, it has given you a focus and determination that few can match. Your vengeful nature makes you a relentless opponent, but it can also blind you to opportunities for alliance or mercy.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Burning Hatred**: Increase your *Vigor* and *Resolve* values by +1. Decrease your *Precision* value by -1.

**Vendetta**: When fighting, tracking, or researching a specific individual who has wronged you or represents what you hate, gain 1 Favor on all task rolls.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Stealth* and *Insight*.

### Zealous

> The titans were gods, and we feast upon their corpses like maggots. Glorious, enlightened maggots.

Your unwavering faith—whether in a deity, philosophy, or cause—defines your existence. This deep-seated conviction gives you strength and purpose, but it can also make you inflexible and judgmental. Your zealotry might be focused on preserving knowledge, destroying corruption, or spreading a particular belief about the nature of the titans and their fall.

You gain the following characteristics:

**True Believer**: Increase your *Resolve* and *Resonance* values by +1. Decrease your *Intellect* value by -1.

**Unwavering Faith**: Once per session, when performing a task that aligns with your beliefs or convictions, you can declare it a matter of faith. Spend 2 essence points to automatically succeed on the task, as long as is a Difficulty 4 task or below.

**Skills**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Occult* and *Mental Defense*.

**Inabilities**: You have the *Incapable* skill rank in *Insight* and *Persuasion*.

# Background


Write the intro to Character Background. It should be similar to the intro to the Temperament chapter, but don’t copy it exactly. Some examples of Backgrounds are Titankin (goliath-like race said to have titan’s blood), Eclipsed (those that have been to the edge of essence corruption, which has changed them), Golems, Enclaver, Wastelander, Revanant (Skeletal humans who have returned from the dead and sustain their existence on essence).

Your character’s Background encompasses their heritage, ancestry, kind, or upbringing. The realms of Eldraia have given rise to a diverse variety of human and non-human existence. From towering titankin who claim ancient kinship with fallen gods, to essence-touched eclipsed who walk the razor’s edge between humanity and corruption, each Background brings a unique perspective of the world to your character.

While it establishes your character’s context within the world, your Background also grants them abilities, characteristics, skills, and modifications to your starting attributes. Titankin tend to have larger frames, granting them superior strength. Your character’s Background might also change your character in a negative way. Some backgrounds give your character inabilities—skills with the **incapable** skill rank. For example, Revenants tend to be societal outcasts, so they have inabilities in social skills. 

Whether your character was born in the relative safety of an enclave, forged in the unforgiving wastes, or emerged from circumstances far more extraordinary, their Background is an integral part of who they are and how others perceive them. 


## List of Backgrounds

### Eclipsed

> The titans aren’t dead. They’re just dreaming. And sometimes… sometimes I dream their dreams too. 

You have been to the edge of essence corruption and made it back alive. Alive, but not unscathed. Your exposure to overwhelming amounts of titan essence has transformed your body and mind, granting you unique abilities but also subjecting you to unpredictable mutations and unstable emotions. You are both feared and revered for these changes, seen as both a potential savior and a ticking time bomb.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Essence Mutation**: Choose one minor physical mutation and one minor mental mutation from the list below. These mutations are a manifestation of your exposure to titan essence and its corrupting influence. Discuss with the GM to determine the specific nature of your mutations.

   - **Minor Physical Mutations**: Glowing eyes, elemental features (e.g., glowing skin, fiery hair), heightened strength or durability, elongated limbs, claws or fangs.
   - **Minor Mental Mutations**: Empathic abilities, telepathic communication with animals, heightened senses (e.g., enhanced vision or hearing), prophetic dreams or visions, resistance to mental effects.

**Essence**: Gain +10 to your Essence Pool.

**Skills**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Resisting Corruption* and *Essence Manipulation*.

3. Your reputation as an eclipsed individual caught the attention of the group seeking someone with unique abilities related to navigating dangerous locations or uncovering ancient secrets tied to titan essence.

### Golem

> Flesh decays, blood spills, bones break. Stone is eternal.

You are not human—you have been made into a living construct made from a blend of titan essence and other materials such as stone, metal, or wood. Your sturdy frame and resilient nature make you a formidable force on the battlefield. You possess a mechanical efficiency and strength that sets you apart from mere mortals.

You gain the following characteristics:

2. The group discovered you dormant in an ancient facility and reactivated you. You joined them out of gratitude or programming.
3. You seek purpose beyond your original design and believe titan reaping might provide answers about your existence.

### Revenant

> Death isn’t always the end. Sometimes it’s a door to something much worse.

Raised from death by titan essence, you teeter on the border between life and death. Your undead existence grants you strength and resilience beyond mortal limits but it also fills you with an insatiable hunger for more essence. Balancing your need for power against maintaining control over your own mind is a constant struggle.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Undying Vigor**: Increase your *Vigor* value by +2.

**Undead Physiology**: You don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. You are immune to disease and poison.

**Essence Reliance**: You rely on titan essence to keep your form from deteriorating. If your Essence Pool reaches 0, gain 2 Folly on all physical tasks until you replenish it.

**Skills**: Increase the rank of the following skills by 1 level: *Intimidation*, *Tolerance*, and *Survival*.

**Inabilities**: You have the *incapable* skill rank in *Persuasion*.

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved with your titan reaping party:

1. You were found by one of the party members while wandering aimlessly, starved for essence.
2. A member of the group has promised that they can help you find a way to halt your decay permanently.
3. You've joined this group mainly because they seem like a reliable source of titan essence.

 
### Titankin

> My ancestors’ bones became mountains. Their blood became oceans.

You are one of the blessed few who bear the bloodline of the titans themselves. This connection grants you enhanced physical abilities and an innate affinity for titan essence. Your heritage is both a gift and a burden, as it draws attention from those who seek to control or exploit your power.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Blood of Giants**: Your titan ancestry manifests in one of the following ways (choose one):
- **Mountain's Blood**: Gain +1 Armor and increase your *Vigor* value by +1.

1. You seek to understand your lineage better by exploring titan carcasses.
2. A member of your family has gone missing and now it's up to you find them.
3. An enigmatic figure known for their knowledge about titans and their essence seeks your aid in locating a hidden titan carcass rumored to hold a powerful artifact.
4. You have experienced visions or dreams that have drawn you to the group and their quest. These visions are believed to be messages from the titans themselves, guiding you toward your destiny.
5. A rival faction has targeted you, believing that capturing or controlling a Titankin will grant them access to immense power. The group offers their protection in exchange for your assistance in their mission.

# Calling

Your character’s Calling is what sets them apart. It’s their unique destiny, talent, or specialized path. While your Role defines your general approach to titan reaping and your Temperament shapes how you interact with the world, your Calling is what makes you truly unique among your peers. It's the answer to the question "What makes my character special?"

Think of your Calling as your character’s signature ability or defining trait. A reaper who *Bonds with Beasts* has formed deep connections with the wild creatures of Eldraia, while one who *Summons Weapons from Memory* can manifest spectral armaments through sheer force of will.

Each Calling establishes a unique set abilities that grow in power as your character advances in level, and can open up new possibilities for what your character can accomplish. A character who *Paints Illusions* gains the unique ability to cast remarkable and highly detailed illusions with essence.

Your Calling is not just a set of mechanical benefits—it's a core part of your character's identity and story. It influences how others perceive you, shapes your approach to challenges, and often drives your personal goals and ambitions. Choose a Calling that resonates with your vision for your character and adds depth to their narrative.

The following sections detail the various Callings available to titan reapers. Each entry includes:

- A brief description of what the Calling represents
- Connection options that link your character to others in the party
- GM Intrusions specific to that Calling
- Abilities gained at each tier of advancement

## Peddles Wares

> "Essence brings strange dreams, and strange dreams create strange desires. I just help connect these dots—for a modest fee, of course."

You’ve mastered the art of knowing what people want, even before they themselves realize it. In a world where resources are scarce and survival uncertain, you’ve turned commerce into a way of life.

You are a merchant of the extraordinary, dealing in rare and powerful items imbued with titan essence. You understand that every artifact has a story, every trinket a purpose, and every buyer a need unfulfilled. Whether you run a permanent shop in an enclave or haul your wares across the wastes, you’ve learned that behind every great hunter or warrior is a savvy trader.

### Tier 1

#### Keen Appraisal
#action #essence-1 

You can attempt to accurately assess the value and properties of any item, ephemeral, or artifact by succeeding on a *Commerce* task. Using this ability also gives you an innate sense of whether there's more to an item than meets the eye, such as hidden compartments or secret enchantments. This ability also reveals if an item is particularly valuable to certain factions or individuals.

#### Silver Tongue
#passive

You gain the following skill specializations: *Negotiating (Commerce)*, *Closing the deal (Persuasion)*, and *Swindling (Deceit)*.

### Tier 2

#### Emergency Supplies
#action #essence-2

In a desperate situation, you quickly produce exactly the right substance needed - whether it's an antidote, a salve, or a specialized tool. Cure one condition (poisoned, burning, etc.) affecting yourself or an ally within immediate range, or gain 1 Favor on your next skill check that requires specialized equipment.

#### Trade Network
#passive

You maintain a web of contacts and information brokers across the enclaves. The trust that you have built with these contacts has gained you their favor. These favors can range from securing rare ephemerals to arranging safe passage through contested territory. Spend 2 essence points to locate a specific uncommon item for purchase or identify a buyer for unusual goods within 1d4 days, regardless of your current location. You and the GM should work out the details of your contacts.

### Tier 3

#### Merchant’s Stash
#action #essence-2 

You always seem to have just what's needed tucked away in your pack or hidden among your wares. You can choose any piece of normal equipment on the standard equipment list, or (no more than once per day) you can allow the GM to determine the object randomly. If you call a random object, it has a 10 percent chance of being an ephemeral or diurnal, a 50 percent chance of being a piece of standard equipment, and a 40 percent chance of being a bit of worthless junk. You can’t use this ability to take an item held by another creature.

#### Last Resort
#action #essence-3

You pull out a concealed weapon or ephemeral you've been saving for emergencies. Make an attack with any weapon you're trained in, even if you don't currently have that weapon equipped, or activate any ephemeral effect you're familiar with (even if you don't have the ephemeral). This ability can only be used once per day.

#### Tier 4

#### Contractual Binding
#action-to-initiate #essence-5

You infuse a written contract with essence, creating a magically binding agreement. If either party willfully breaks the terms of the contract, they suffer 2d6 psychic damage each day until they take steps to rectify the breach. This contract remains binding for a number of days equal to your _Resolve_ value.

#### Rare Acquisition
#passive 

Once per week, you manage to obtain an item or ephemeral that is considered rare or unusual.

### Tier 5

#### Aura of Prestige
#passive 

Your reputation precedes you, lending an aura of credibility and desirability to everything you sell. When dealing with titan essence-infused items or artifacts, gain 2 Favors on any tasks related to selling or trading such items.

#### Flawless Barter
#passive

You give a immaculate performance, convincing any potential buyer of the absolute worth and necessity of your wares. Any time you push a *Commerce* related task, step the Surge Dice rating up by 2 levels.

## Bonds with Beasts

> “The wilds whisper, and I listen. These creatures—survivors, they are. In their eyes, I see something familiar... something that remembers the world before.”

You possess a rare and precious gift—the ability to forge deep connections with the creatures of Eldraia. While others see only danger in the essence-warped beasts that roam the wastelands, you perceive their true nature and potential. Through patience, empathy, and a touch of essence, you've learned to communicate with, tame, and even form lasting bonds with these remarkable beings.

Your companions may rely on steel and essence, but you understand that sometimes the most powerful ally is a loyal beast at your side. Whether you command a pack of swift scavengers, ride atop a massive titan-touched mount, or communicate with the tiny creatures that others overlook, your bond with these animals gives you unique insights and abilities that other reapers can only marvel at.

### Tier 1

#### Beast Companion
#passive 

A creature of your choosing accompanies you and follows your instructions. Choose one of the creatures below or work with your GM to determine the details of your creature. Your *Beast Companion* gains abilities according to your character tier. Beast abilities that have an associated Essence pool cost are paid out of your character’s Essence pool. Your companion’s level scales with your level according to the following:

Base Creature Level + Your Level halved, rounded down. For example, a Skoxen bonded with a level 5 character will have a level of 4, a target number of 12, 16 health, and deal 6 damage. If your beast companion dies, you can hunt in the wild for 2d6 days to find a new one.

#### Shared Instincts
#passive

You and your beast companion can communicate non-verbally, conveying basic emotions, intentions, and simple commands. Your beast companion can also give you very basic answers to simple questions.

### Tier 2

#### Synchronized Assault
#passive

When you and your companion from the Beast Companion ability are within *Near* distance of each other, you inflict 2 additional points of damage when you attack and both of you gain an asset to defense actions.

### Tier 3

#### Beast Eyes
#action-to-initiate #essence-4 

By linking to the creature from your Beast Companion ability, you can perceive through its senses if it is within *Vast* distance of you. This effect lasts up to ten minutes.

#### Essence Bond
#action-to-initiate #essence-3 

You infuse your beast companion with titan essence, enhancing its natural abilities. For one hour, your beast companion gains an additional Favor on all actions that involve its natural talents (such as tracking for a Fendir or controlling plants for a Veldrake).

### Tier 5

#### As If One
#passive 

When you and your beast are within *Near* distance of each other, you can share damage inflicted on either of you. For instance, if one of you is struck by a weapon for 4 points of damage, divide the damage between the two of you as you see fit. Only the Armor and resistances of the target initially damaged come into play. So if you have 2 Armor and are struck by a force blast for 4 points of damage, your beast can take the 2 points of damage you would suffer, but their Armor does not come into play, nor does their immunity to force blasts, if any.

### Beast Companions

#### Fendir

##### Tier 1

###### Fendir

Your _Beast Companion_ is a fendir with a base level of 2. As a level 2 creature, it has a target number of 6, 6 health, and has a bite attack that inflicts 1d6 points of damage.

###### Essence Sniffer

Your fendir can detect the presence of titan essence within *Near* distance and can follow essence trails that are up to three days old. Your fendir has the following skill specializations: *Scent Tracking (Awareness)*, *Detecting Essence (Awareness)*.

##### Tier 2

###### Loyal Guardian
#passive #essence-3

Your fendir takes a defensive stance around you. while within *Close* distance to you, your fendir provides a Favor on all *Physical Defense* and *Awareness* tasks. This effect lasts for ten minutes.

##### Tier 3

###### Shadow Stride
#action-to-initiate #essence-4 

For ten minutes, you and your Fendir can move silently and leave no tracks. You can walk across snow without leaving footprints and dry leaves without making a sound. During this time, you and your fendir gain 2 Favors on *Stealth* tasks.

##### Tier 4

###### Pack Tactics
#passive 

You and your fendir have learned to attack in sync. When both you and your fendir attack the same target in the same combat round, both attacks gain a Favor.

##### Tier 5

###### Spirit Form
#action-to-initiate #essence-8

For up to ten minutes, your Fendir becomes partially incorporeal. In this state, it can pass through solid objects no thicker than its body, is immune to physical attacks from non-essence infused weapons, and can run across water or other liquids without sinking. While in this form, the Fendir's attacks deal half damage to physical creatures but double damage to essence-infused or spiritual entities.

## Refines Essence

> Titan essence is the most pure form of creation in the universe. Once you understand it, you can coax it, shape it, and bind it to your will.

You possess the rare talent of refining and purifying titan essence. You transform it into potent artifacts of power. Through meticulous study, you have learned to refine raw titan essence into stable, purposeful forms, creating potent ephemerals that channel specific aspects of the titans’ former might.

Understanding the subtle art of distillation, resonance, and transmutation allows you to craft stable vessels of essence. The secrets of your techniques are bound within a codex, a personalized grimoire containing your unique formulas, diagrams, and notations. This codex is both your greatest tool and your most treasured possession, representing years of experimentation and discovery.

### Tier 1

#### Refiner

You have the skill specialization *Essence Refinement (Craft)*.

#### Refiner’s Kit

You own a Refiner’s Kit, a collection of tools and materials used by skilled refiners to purify and shape titan essence into powerful artifacts. Includes specialized alchemical ingredients, purification vials, and enchanting runes.

#### Refiner’s Codex

As a Refiner, you keep a compendium of schema for crafting ephemerals. Choose three ephemerals. You have the knowledge to craft any of these ephemerals. You also always have the materials to craft these ephemerals, unless otherwise noted by the GM.

#### Refine Essence

You are able to refine raw titan essence into usable ephemerals. This process requires time and concentration due to the volatile nature of titan essence. 

Decide the type of the Ephemeral you wish to craft. The GM will assign a base difficulty (often 1 + the desired level of the ephemeral), Essence cost, and time to create. Note that some ephemerals have the same effect no matter what level they are. In these cases, the base difficulty set by the GM may higher.

### Tier 2

#### Increase Potential

When you craft an ephemeral, you can choose to infuse it with additional Essence. For every 3 additional motes of essence spent, increase the level of the ephemeral crafted by 1, up to the maximum level the ephemeral can be. You can choose to do this after succeeding in your crafting roll.

### Tier 3

#### Expanded Codex

Choose three additional ephemerals to add to your codex.

#### Infusion
#action-to-initiate #essence-6

You can infuse an existing non-ephemeral item with titan essence, temporarily granting it special properties. The infusion lasts for a number of hours equal to your Resonance value. Choose one of the following effects when you infuse the item:
- A weapon deals an additional 2 damage
- A piece of armor grants +1 Armor
- A tool provides 2 Favors on relevant skill checks
- A mundane item gains a minor magical property (such as glowing, becoming unbreakable, or hovering in place)

### Tier 4

#### Recover Essence

Your knowledge of ephemerals allows you to siphon the essence from ephemerals. Recover 1d6 + the ephemeral’s level essence points to your Essence Pool. This ability renders the ephemeral unusable.

### Tier 5

#### Grand Codex

Choose five additional ephemerals to add to your codex.

#### Reverse Engineer

Given enough time and sufficient materials, you are able to reverse engineer an existing ephemeral you have in your possession in order to add them to your codex. The GM will assign a difficulty level appropriate to the ephemeral. On a success, the ephemeral is added to your codex and is available to be crafted. Whether you succeed or not, the existing ephemeral is destroyed in the process and rendered unusable.

## Conjures Flame

> Fire was the first gift of the titans. Though they are gone, the flame they left behind entombs within us a primal invitation—an invocation of fear and reverence.

You have awakened an ancient connection to the primal essence of fire. It is said that the first titans endowed humans with it. The dawning of humans ascension into something more than animals. Though the might of this ancient force has diminished, echoes of that power now lives on in you. Through careful study or innate talent, you’ve learned to call forth essence-infused flames that respond to your will and intent.

Whether you're a measured pyromancer carefully studying each aspect of your craft, or a wild-hearted reaper who delights in the chaos and transformation of the blaze, your flame burns with a will of it’s own. Unlike common fire, the flames you summon bear distinct properties of titan essence.. They can burn with unnatural intensity, take on strange colors, or even consume things ordinary fire cannot touch. 


### Tier 1

#### Searing Bolt
#action #essence-1

You hurl a bolt of concentrated flame at a target within *Near* range. Make an *Essence Manipulation* attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

#### Flame Affinity
#passive

You gain the skill specialization *Fire Resistance (Physical Defense)*.

### Tier 2

#### Heat Sense
#passive

You can detect sources of significant heat within *Near* range, even through thin barriers or in total darkness. This includes living beings, active machinery, and hidden fires. You gain 1 Favor on *Awareness* tasks related to detecting heat sources or thermal variations.

#### Manipulate Flame
#action

You can shape flames to your will, allowing you to interact with fire in unique ways. For example, you can move small fires, create shapes with flames, or extinguish them with a touch.

### Tier 3

#### Fire Whisperer
#action-to-initiate #essence-2

For 10 minutes, you can communicate with and partially control natural fires. You can ask simple questions about what a fire has "seen" or "consumed," and existing flames will bend and move according to your will (within the limits of their fuel). You cannot create new fires with this ability, only influence those already burning.

#### Flame Stance
#action-to-initiate #essence-2 

At your command, your entire body becomes shrouded in flames that last up to one minute or until you dismiss them with an action. While active, your fire abilities that normally cost essence are free. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 fire damage. The fire doesn’t burn you, but it automatically inflicts 1d6 points of damage to anyone that ends their turn within *Close* distance of you. Flames from another source can still hurt you. While the shroud is active, you gain +4 Armor against fire damage from other sources.

### Tier 4

#### Wall of Flame
#action #essence-8

You create a wall of roaring fire up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high that lasts for 10 minutes. The wall can be straight or curved as you choose. Any creature that moves through the wall takes 2d6 fire damage. The wall sheds bright light out to *Near* range and blocks line of sight.

#### Flame Servant
#action-to-initiate #essence-4

You conjure a servant made of living flame that obeys your mental commands. The Flame Servant appears in an unoccupied space within *Near* range and remains for 10 minutes or until dismissed. It has a level equal to your tier and deals 1d6 fire damage with its attacks.

The servant can perform simple tasks like carrying light objects (which it doesn't burn unless you wish it to), providing light equivalent to a bonfire, keeping you warm in harsh conditions, or fighting on your behalf. It cannot move more than *Near* distance from you, and it dissipates if it takes damage equal to your *Resonance* score.

### Tier 5
#### Phoenix Essence
#passive #essence-8

Once per day when your health pool would be reduced to 0, you can instead erupt in a blast of healing fire. You immediately regain health equal to your *Resonance* score. Make an *Essence Manipulation* roll against all creatures within *Immediate* range (friend or foe). On success, each creature takes 2d6 fire damage.

#### Titan's Pyre
#action #essence-10

You summon a raging inferno of titan-infused flames that encompasses a *Near* radius centered on a point within *Far* distance. The area becomes difficult terrain and any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 1d8 fire damage. The inferno lasts for 1 minute and can ignite even normally non-flammable materials. As an action, you can command the flames to form a fiery construct (such as a hand, serpent, or bird) that can make an attack against a creature within the area, dealing 1d12 fire damage on a hit.


# Ephemerals

Shaped by the hands of skilled refiners, Ephemerals are shards of a titan’s power distilled into physical form. They are powerful, magical items that provide the wielder with abilities beyond the scope of mortal capabilities. Each ephemeral holds a sliver of a titan's power and is highly sought after by titan reapers, factions, and collectors throughout Eldraia.

For all their power, Ephemerals are capricious and fragile. The very essence within them that grants incredible effects makes them unstable, prone to crumbling to dust or violently unraveling with little warning.

## Ephemeral Forms

Ephemerals can take on many different forms. The exact physical nature of an ephemeral does not affect its abilities. An elixir that allows the drinker to hide in plain sight is functionally identical to a cloak that does the same thing. 

That said, some PCs may gain the skills to craft ephemerals of their choosing. The ephemerals listed in this chapter are given a specific manifest form along with the suggested materials required to craft the ephemeral. Players, as well as the GM, should feel empowered to reflavor the ephemerals to suit their character's aesthetic or the specific circumstances of their campaign.

Some common forms that ephemerals take include:

### Elixirs and Potions
These liquid ephemerals are imbibed to grant their effects. They often come in small vials or flasks, glowing with the essence contained within. Elixirs and potions are crafted by distilling titan essence and infusing it with various reagents, herbs, and minerals.

### Charms and Talismans
Charms and talismans are small, portable ephemerals that are worn or carried. They can take the form of pendants, rings, bracelets, or other jewelry. These ephemerals are crafted by encasing a shard of titan essence within a protective housing, often made of precious metals or rare materials.

### Glyphstones
Glyphstones are flat pieces of stone carved with arcane sigils imbued with the will of its creator through titan essence. They are typically palm-sized, and can be made of a variety of minerals depending on the exactly nature of the ephemeral.

### Scrolls and Tomes
Ephemerals can also take the form of inscribed scrolls or tomes. The words and sigils upon these items are imbued with titan essence, and the effects are triggered when read aloud. Scrolls and tomes are created by scribing intricate patterns and formulae using essence-infused inks.

### Curiosities
Not all ephemerals fall into neat categories. Some are unique curiosities, objects imbued with titan essence in strange and unexpected ways. A music box that summons spectral dancers, a mirror that reveals hidden truths, or a seed that grows into a sentient plant are all examples of the wondrous and bizarre forms ephemerals can take.

Ultimately, the form an ephemeral takes is limited only by the imagination of its creator and the needs of the wielder.
## Crafting Ephemerals

While most ephemerals are found as treasures or purchased from specialist dealers, some titan reapers learn the art of crafting their own. Crafting an ephemeral requires a source of raw titan essence (motes), the appropriate materials for the desired form, and the knowledge of the intricate techniques involved. PCs with the [[7. Calling#Refines Essence|Refines Essence]] focus have a compendium of ephemerals that gives them the knowledge to craft  ephemerals.

### Crafting Materials

The materials needed for crafting ephemerals are as varied as the forms the ephemerals themselves take. A skilled refiner might need rare herbs found only in the depths of a corrupted forest to brew a potion of invisibility, or they might require a shard of crystallized essence from a specific titan to forge a blade that can cut through any material.

These materials serve a greater purpose than just being a checklist of components. They are hooks for adventure, threads that the GM can use to introduce elements of narrative into the story. A PC might be driven to explore the dangerous waters of the Endless Mire in search of a rare type of tree that only grows at the base of the titan Myrandel in order to craft a particular type of totem. Materials could also be gathered passively as players explore the world.

However, materials gathering should never feel like a hinderance to the players or the GM. Feel free to drop the requirement for materials entirely if it detracts from the main story or hinders the pace of the game in any way.

### Crafting an Ephemeral

To craft an ephemeral, a PC needs three things:

1. A source of raw titan essence (motes)
2. The appropriate materials for the desired form of the ephemeral
3. The knowledge of how to craft that specific ephemeral

Adjust these amounts based on the specific ephemeral and the needs of their campaign.

As for the knowledge required, there are a few ways a PC could gain the expertise to craft a particular ephemeral:

- **Schematics or Formulae**: The PC has discovered ancient texts, scrolls, or tomes that detail the process for crafting the ephemeral. These could be found as treasure, purchased from specialist dealers, or gifted by a mentor.

- **Observation**: The PC has seen the ephemeral being crafted before, either by another refiner or in a vision granted by a titan's memory. By studying the process, they have gleaned enough understanding to attempt it themselves, though the GM may impose a higher difficulty for the crafting task.

- **Experimentation**: For PCs with the Refines Essence focus, crafting a new ephemeral could be a matter of trial and error. The PC expends time and resources experimenting with different techniques and materials until they discover a working method. This approach is likely to be more time and resource intensive than working from established knowledge.

When a PC attempts to craft an ephemeral, the GM assigns a base difficulty (often 1 + the desired level of the ephemeral), essence cost, and time to create. Some ephemerals have the same effect no matter what level they are. In these cases, the base difficulty set by the GM may higher. On a success, the ephemeral is crafted and ready for use. On a failure, the essence is consumed but the materials can be re-used in subsequent attempts.

## Gaining and Using Ephemerals

Ephemerals are items designed for frequent discovery and use. PCs can have only a small number of ephemerals at any given time, and since they’re always finding more, they’re encouraged to use them at a steady pace. 

Players may find ephemerals while reaping titans, left behind from previous adventurers that perished within, as rewards from factions or individuals, purchased from the bustling markets of enclaves, or even crafted by PCs with the right skills.

Ephemerals are gained with such regularity that the PCs should feel that they can use them freely. There will always be more, and they’ll have different benefits. This means that in gameplay, cyphers are less like gear or treasure and more like character abilities that the players don’t choose. This leads to fun game moments where a player can say “Well, I’ve got an X that might help in this situation,” and X is always different. X might be a burst of inhuman strength, the ability to see in the dark, or an innate ability to understand any language. X can be anything.
## Why Ephemerals?

Ephemerals are the lifeblood of the titan reaper's arsenal in When Titans Fell. For the PCs, ephemerals serve as more than mere tools—they are a manifestation of the risks and rewards that define their existence. Each venture into the titanic carcasses scattered across Eldraia holds the promise of discovering new ephemerals, each with its own unique and often unpredictable abilities. One day, a reaper might stumble upon an elixir that grants them temporary invulnerability; the next, they may find a glyphstone that summons forth a tempest of lightning.

From a gameplay perspective, ephemerals inject a sense of dynamic flexibility into character abilities. Rather than being locked into a static set of abilities, PCs must learn to improvise and strategize on the fly, making the most of whatever ephemerals they have at their disposal. This creates a fast-paced, reactive style of play that keeps everyone at the table engaged and on their toes. 

For the GM, ephemerals offer a flexible tool for shaping the flow and tenor of the narrative. A carefully placed ephemeral can serve as a subtle nudge, guiding the titan reapers down a particular path or opening up new avenues of exploration. Alternatively, a more freeform or random approach to ephemeral distribution can empower the players to take the story in unexpected directions, as they leverage their newfound abilities to tackle challenges in creative ways. 

## Ephemeral Dangers

Each ephemeral contains a concentrated slice of titanic power, and this power yearns to be unleashed. When too many ephemerals are gathered in one place, their combined energy creates a sort of resonance, a building wave of instability that threatens to overwhelm the carrier.

For each ephemeral a character carries beyond their limit, any tasks they attempt to resist corruption are hindered by one step. This represents the mental and physical strain of containing the excess power.

Further, if a character is carrying ephemerals in excess of their limit, the GM can introduce unexpected complications tied to the volatile nature of the items. An ephemeral might suddenly activate without warning, causing a surge of uncontrolled power. Or an ephemeral might unexpectedly burn out, crumbling to dust when the character attempts to use it. In extreme cases, an overloaded character might even suffer a spontaneous essence detonation, taking damage and potentially harming those around them.

At the GM’s discretion when a player is carrying above their capacity of ephemerals, roll a 1d6 on the following table (or choose from one of the options) to determine the effect:

Here is the table for the effects of carrying too many ephemerals:

| Roll | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Spontaneous Activation**: One of the ephemerals activates without warning. The GM chooses the ephemeral and determines the effect, which could be beneficial, detrimental, or simply chaotic.                                              |
| 2    | **Essence Leak**: The character begins to leak essence, leaving a faint trail that can be detected by essence-sensitive creatures or individuals. This may attract unwanted attention.                                                       |
| 3    | **Corrupted Ephemeral**: One of the ephemerals becomes corrupted. When used, it has a twisted, unintended effect determined by the GM.                                                                                                       |
| 4    | **Resonance Feedback**: The character experiences painful feedback from the resonating ephemerals. They take 2 points of Intellect damage that ignores armor each round until they reduce their ephemeral count below their limit.           |
| 5    | **Ephemeral Burnout**: One of the ephemerals suddenly burns out and crumbles to dust, becoming unusable. The GM determines which ephemeral is lost.                                                                                          |
| 6    | **Essence Detonation**: The excess ephemerals violently detonate. The character and all creatures within immediate range must make a Speed Defense Roll with a level equal to the ephemeral’s level, inflicting 6 points of physical damage. |

## Crafting Ephemerals

Crafting ephemerals is a delicate art, requiring a combination of technical skill, arcane knowledge, and a steady supply of titan essence. While most ephemerals are discovered in the field or purchased from specialist vendors, some titan reapers choose to craft their own, tailoring the effects to their specific needs. 

Crafting an ephemeral has two main costs: the essence cost and the material cost.

- **Essence Cost**: The amount of essence required, in motes, is determined by the level of the ephemeral being crafted.

- **Material Cost**: The materials required for an ephemeral can range from common to extremely rare. The GM determines the availability and cost of these materials based on the setting and the specific ephemeral being crafted. In some cases, the material cost might be replaced by a quest to gather rare components.

## Crafting Limitations

Crafting ephemerals is not without its risks and limitations:

- **Skill Requirements**: Crafting an ephemeral requires proficiency in the numenera crafting skill. The difficulty of the crafting task is determined by the level of the ephemeral.

- **Time Investment**: Crafting an ephemeral takes time, typically one day per level of the ephemeral. This can be reduced with the help of assistants or special facilities.

- **Essence Strain**: Working with raw titan essence can be taxing on the crafter. For each day spent crafting, the crafter must make an Intellect defense roll to avoid taking 2 points of Intellect damage that ignores armor.

Crafting ephemerals offers titan reapers a degree of control over their capabilities, but it also requires significant investment and comes with its own set of risks. For many, the promise of a perfectly tailored tool is worth the effort and danger.

**Materials**: Sea glass, driftwood

**Effect**: When the Glass Knife's blade is shattered, an ethereal blade takes its place, semi-translucent and glowing faintly. For the next day, each time the blade strikes a solid creature or object, it generates a burst of energy that teleports the creature or object an immediate distance in a random direction (not up or down). The teleported creature's actions (including defense) are hindered on its next turn (1 Folly, or 2 Follies if the ephemeral level is 5 or higher). After a day, the blade vanishes, and the user is left with a stick of driftwood.

### Clay Corpse

**Crafting Cost**: 2 motes of essence

**Materials**: The thumb of a skilled gardener or druid, embalming fluid

**Effect**: When the Verdant Thumb is buried in soil, it causes plants in the area to grow rapidly. The effect covers a short distance and lasts for one minute per ephemeral level. Plants affected by this growth become dense and tough and seem to have a mind of their own. The user and their allies are unaffected, the plants seeming to part and make way for their movements, while any foes within the affected area have their movement and physical actions hindered by 1 Folly as the plants and vines entwine around them.

### Inverted Bell

**Level**: 1d6 + 3

**Effect**: When the Inverted Bell is rung, it silences all sound within long range for one round per cypher level. Within the affected area, no sound can be heard.

## Currency

In the world of Eldraia, traditional notions of wealth and commerce have been upended. The collapse of established societies and the lack of centralized governments have rendered conventional currencies useless. In their stead, **essence shards** have become the de facto currency of Eldraia.

Essence shards are fragments of titan essence that have been meticulously refined and standardized by the skilled artisans of the enclaves. These shards are small, glowing fragments that pulsate with energy. They vary in size, but are typically no larger than the palm of a hand.

The process of creating essence shards is labor-intensive and dangerous, requiring careful handling to avoid overexposure. Extracted titan essence must first be purified to eliminate any impurities. It is then broken down into smaller fragments using specialized tools - a delicate process that risks damaging the shard’s inherent magic if done incorrectly.

Besides their value as currency, essence shards can be used directly in powerful magical rituals or as fuel for enchanted devices. Many magic-users prefer to be paid in shards for this reason, while artisans and blacksmiths may demand them to power their forges and workshops.

This unique feature sets essence shards apart from traditional forms of currency. Instead of merely accumulating wealth, one must balance their economic needs against the tactical advantages provided by essence shards.

### Standardized Shards

![|450](essence_shards.webp "right")

Most transactions in Eldraia are conducted using standardized small shards of essence known as **skor (ᚪ)**. One skor—about the size of a fingernail – might buy a loaf of bread or a mug of ale in an enclave tavern. A **dram (ᚧ)**, roughly the size of a thumb, might buy a decent weapon or a night’s stay at a comfortable inn. A **keld (ᚳ)**, the size of a fist, could buy a horse or bribe an enclave guard. And an **orin (ᛟ)**, as large as a person’s forearm or bigger, is so valuable it could purchase an entire property or finance an expedition into the wastelands. Orins are almost never seen in common circulation and are instead reserved for monumental transactions or kept as treasures by powerful individuals or factions.

> The name “skor” comes from the old Cyndaran word “skora”, meaning “fragment” or “splinter”. “Dram” finds its roots in the ancient word “drammar”, signifying “value” or “worth”. “Keld” is derived from the word “kelda”, meaning “fate”. “Orin” comes from the word “orwena”, meaning “ruler”.

As titan reapers venture further from civilization and closer to the fallen titans themselves, they may find themselves trading not in refined essence shards but raw essence chunks - raw and unprocessed fragments of titan essence that can be incredibly dangerous to handle but are immensely valuable.

Essence shard exchange rates:

| Shard Size | skor (ᚪ) | dram (ᚧ) | keld (ᚳ) | orin (ᛟ) |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| skor (ᚪ)   | 1        | 1/10     | 1/100    | 1/10000  |
| dram (ᚧ)   | 10       | 1        | 1/10     | 1/1000   |
| keld (ᚳ)   | 100      | 10       | 1        | 1/100    |
| orin (ᛟ)   | 10000    | 1000     | 100      | 1        |

Though the enclaves have done their best to standardize shards for trading, disputes over shard values are common, and fraudulent activities such as shard tampering, where less scrupulous individuals attempt to pass off ordinary crystals or artificially inflated shards as genuine essence shards.

Many have attempted to forge essence shards, but any experienced refiner or Titan Reaper can easily spot the lack of the distinct energy pulsation that genuine essence shards possess. Such deception is considered a grave offense and is usually met with severe punishment, often death.

### Depleted Shards

Shards are often used by titan reapers to replenish their reserve of Essence. When a shard is used in this way, it becomes **depleted**. These depleted shards are much less valuable, but can still be used as a form of currency. Depleted shards have a dull glow and lack the pulsating energy of their fully charged counterparts. They are worth only about one-tenth of the original value.

Depleted shards are commonly used in transactions that don't require the full power of a fresh shard, such as purchasing basic supplies or services. They are also accepted by refiners as partial payment for the creation of ephemerals or diurnals, as they can still contain trace amounts of essence that can be extracted during refinement.

While depleted shards are not as desirable as fully charged essence shards, they are still a valuable resource in Eldraia. Resourceful individuals may find creative uses for depleted shards, such as using them in alchemical experiments or as fuel for certain types of machinery.

It is worth noting that some unscrupulous individuals may attempt to pass off depleted shards as fully charged ones. It is always wise to test the authenticity of a shard before completing any transactions, especially when dealing with unfamiliar or suspicious individuals.

### Other Forms of Currency

#### Faction-Specific Currencies

Certain factions within Eldraia have developed their own unique forms of currency, exclusive to their territories or influence.

The Pact, a coalition of enclaves seeking to restore order to the lawless wastelands, has been attempting to establish their own currency as a means of unifying their faction and exerting control over the flow of resources. This currency, known as **fenier (ᛃ)**, colloquially known as “fen”, takes the form of finely crafted coins made from precious metals such as silver or gold.

![|400](fen.webp "left")

> The name "fenier" is derived from the ancient term "fenguein," meaning "to unite" or "to bind together." The Pact sees this currency as a tangible representation of their mission to bring harmony and stability to Eldraia.

Fen are stamped with the symbol of the Pact - a stylized flame.

While fen have limited acceptance outside of the Pact's influence, some enterprising individuals have started recognizing their value due to the influence and resources controlled by the faction. However, outside factions often view fen with suspicion or outright reject it, preferring to stick with the more universally accepted essence shards.

The Pact hopes that by establishing fen as a fiat currency within their territories, they can consolidate power and build trust among their members while reducing reliance on external trade. Whether they succeed in this endeavor remains to be seen, but it is clear that they are willing to put forth considerable effort towards achieving this goal.

The Order of the Ivory Eye, a secretive cult that worships a fallen titan, uses "Eyes of the Titan" as their currency. These small polished stones resembling eyes are believed to possess mystical properties and are highly sought after by members of the Order.

Similarly, the Iron Fist Syndicate, a ruthless group of mercenaries and black market traders, utilizes forged metal coins known as "Ironmarks." Each Ironmark is stamped with the Syndicate's insignia and holds symbolic significance within the criminal underworld.


#### Bartering

Bartering is common in Eldraia, especially in the more remote or lawless areas where access to essence shards or faction currencies is limited. Commodities like food, weapons, armor, information, or services might be used for trade. However, the value of these items can vary greatly depending on the current situation and location.

For instance, in a remote outpost beset by dangerous creatures, weapons and armor might become exceedingly valuable. On the other hand, in a bustling enclave with a bustling blacksmith industry, these items might not bring much in trade.

Bartering requires negotiation skills and knowledge of current market trends. A clever negotiator could turn a seemingly worthless item into a treasure through keen bargaining.

## Armor

As a titan reaper, armor can be a crucial aspect of survival. Whether it be the twisted abominations born from titan essence or rival factions seeking to claim your hard-earned loot, armor provides protection against the myriad threats that lurk in the shadows.

You can wear only one type of armor at a time—you cannot wear chainmail underneath plate armor, for example. However, Armor bonuses from multiple sources combine to provide a total Armor rating. For example, a character wearing leather armor (+2 Armor) and a reinforced cloak (+1 Armor) would have a total Armor rating of +3.

### Using Armor

Anyone can wear any armor, but it can be taxing. Wearing armor increases the cost of using a level of Effort when attempting a Speed task.

The following table displays types of armor, the bonus they provide to a PC's Armor characteristic, and the additional cost (in points from their Speed Pool) the PC must spend for each level of Effort used when attempting a Speed task. By default, PCs use the Not Experienced with Armor column. However, if a PC has one or more special abilities that reduce Speed Effort cost for wearing armor—**Practiced in Armor**, **Experienced in Armor**, and **Mastery in Armor**—they can use the corresponding column on the table instead.

| Physical armor | Armor Bonus | Not Experienced with Armor | Practiced in Armor | Experienced in Armor | Mastery in Armor |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Light armor    | +1 Armor    | +2                         | +1                 | 0                    | 0                |
| Medium armor   | +2 Armor    | +3                         | +2                 | +1                   | 0                |
| Heavy armor    | +3 Armor    | +4                         | +3                 | +2                   | 0                |

For example, let's say you have the Practiced in Armor ability and are wearing light armor. If you use two levels of Effort on a Speed task to run across difficult terrain, it costs 7 points from your Speed Pool rather than 5 (3 for the first level of Effort, plus 2 for the second level of Effort, plus 2 for wearing light armor—1 per level of Effort used). Edge reduces the overall cost as normal.

Reducing the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor is also possible through character advancement.

#### Shields

Shields don't provide a bonus to your Armor characteristic. Instead, a shield—or anything else functioning as one—provides an asset to Speed defense rolls. Exactly how common shields as equipment are will vary by genre. Anyone can use a shield so long as they dedicate free hand to its use. [[4. Role#The Savant|Savant]] abilities also require a free hand to use unless the GM says otherwise.

### Light Armor

|Light Armor|Armor|Speed Effort Additional Cost <br/> (Practiced)|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|Heavy Cloth|1*|0|<Shard a={3} d="dram">3 dram</Shard>|
|Hide|1|1|<Shard a={5} d="dram">5 dram</Shard>|
|Leather Armor|1|1|<Shard a={10} d="dram">10 dram</Shard>|
|Titan-leather Armor|2|1|<Shard a={75} d="dram">75 dram</Shard>|


*_Indicates a special armor rating. See the description below for more details._

Light armor provides minimal protection, offering agility and mobility over heavy defensive capabilities. It is often favored by those who value speed and flexibility in combat or exploration.

**Heavy Cloth**
> Clothing that's heavy enough to reduce the effect of attacks against you, such as winter clothing or a fashionable leather outfit. Heavy cloth provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.


**Hide**
> Made from thick hide and fur, this armor is often crafted from the remains of large creatures such as bears or dire wolves. The sturdy nature of the hide provides excellent protection against slashing and piercing attacks. Hide armor is favored by those who need a balance between protection and mobility.

**Leather Armor**
> A common choice among titan reapers, leather armor is made from the hides of various creatures that roam Eldraia. It provides basic protection against physical attacks without hindering mobility. The supple leather is often reinforced with metal or bone plates in key areas for additional defense.


**Titan-leather Armor**
> Armor made from the hide of a titan. Titan-leather armor offers superior protection compared to other types of light armor. It is made from the hide of a titan, which possesses incredible durability and resilience. The unique properties of titan leather allow it to absorb and disperse the force of attacks, reducing the impact on the wearer.

### Medium Armor

|Medium Armor|Armor|Speed Effort Additional Cost (Inexperienced)|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|Chainmail|2|2|<Shard a={25} d="dram">25 dram</Shard>|
|Iron Breastplate|2|2|<Shard a={50} d="dram">50 dram</Shard>|
|Titansteel Cuirass|2*|2|<Shard a={110} d="dram">110 dram</Shard>|
|Titan Bone Half Plate|2|0|<Shard a={175} d="dram">175 dram</Shard>

Medium armor strikes a balance between protection and mobility, offering moderate defense against various types of attacks. It is favored by those who seek a blend of resilience and maneuverability in combat or exploration.

**Chainmail**
> Interlocking metal rings form a flexible mesh that covers the body, providing solid protection against slashing and piercing attacks. Chainmail is relatively heavy but offers good defense without compromising mobility.

**Iron Breastplate**
> A sturdy breastplate made from iron plates riveted together. This armor is designed to protect vital organs, offering strong defense against slashing and piercing attacks. The weight of the breastplate can be cumbersome, but its durability makes it a reliable choice for those who prioritize protection.


![|400](titansteel.webp "right")

**Titansteel Cuirass**
> Formed from refined titan essence-infused steel, this cuirass offers excellent protection against physical attacks. In addition to its defensive capabilities, the titansteel cuirass provides **2 Armor** against magical attacks, mitigating the effects of spells and other magical abilities. The infusion of titan essence within the metal also grants it a faint glimmer, hinting at its origins in the fallen titans.

**Titan Bone Half Plate**
> Carved from the incredibly durable and lightweight bones salvaged from fallen titans. The lattice structure of the titan bones provides excellent protection while minimizing weight.

### Heavy Armor

|Heavy Armor|Armor|Speed Effort Additional Cost (Inexperienced)|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|Scale|3|3|<Shard a={60} d="dram">60 dram</Shard>|
|Full Plate|3|2|<Shard a={190} d="dram">190 dram</Shard>|
|Titan Bone Plate|3|1|<Shard a={275} d="dram">275 dram</Shard>|
|Titansteel Scale Mail|3*|3|<Shard a={350} d="dram">350 dram</Shard>|

Heavy armor provides maximum protection at the cost of reduced mobility. It is favored by those who prioritize defense over agility in combat or exploration.

![|300](bone_full_plate.webp "right")

**Scale**
> Large, overlapping metal scales are attached to a flexible backing, creating a suit of armor that offers superior protection.

**Full Plate**
> A complete suit of armor consisting of interlocking metal plates that cover the entire body.

**Titan Bone Plate**

## Weapons

Not all characters are familiar with all weapons. [[4. Role#The Ward|Wards]] know their way around most types, but [[4. Role#The Hunter|Hunters]] prefer light or medium weapons, and [[4. Role#The Savant|Savants]] and [[4. Role#The Negotiator|Negotiators]]usually stick to light weapons. If you wield a weapon that you have no experience with, an attack with that weapon is hindered. Having experience with a weapon is called being **practiced** with the weapon.

Weapons come in three categories: light, medium, and heavy.

**Light weapons** usually deal 1d4 damage, but attacks with them are eased because they are agile and easy to wield, allowing for quick strikes and maneuverability. They are favored by those who prioritize speed and precision over sheer strength. Light weapons include daggers, short swords, hand axes, and small bows.

**Medium weapons** usually deal 1d8 damage and are the most common type of weapon. They strike a balance between speed and power, providing versatility in combat. Medium weapons include longswords, warhammers, spears, and longbows.

**Heavy weapons** are slower but deal greater damage, usually 1d12 or 2d6. They require more strength to handle effectively and are often two-handed. Heavy weapons include greatswords, battleaxes, polearms, and crossbows.

Some heavy weapons have a long reach such as halberds. This long reach allows characters to stay out of reach of enemies with standard melee weapons. These weapons only deal 1d10 damage, but give an asset on defense rolls against physical attacks with an immediate range.
